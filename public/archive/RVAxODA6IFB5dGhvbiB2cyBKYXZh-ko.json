{"title":"EP180: Python vs Java","content":"<body>\n    <h2>Kiss bugs goodbye with fully automated end-to-end test coverage</h2>\n    <p>QA Wolf's AI-native service provides high-volume, high-speed test coverage for web and mobile apps, reducing your organizations QA cycle to less than 15 minutes. They can get you:\n        <ul>\n            <li>80% automated E2E test coverage in weeks</li>\n            <li>Unlimited parallel test runs</li>\n            <li>24-hour maintenance and on-demand test creation</li>\n            <li>Zero flakes, guaranteed</li>\n        </ul>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Python vs Java</h2>\n    <p>\n        <ul>\n            <li>Python (CPython Runtime): Python source code is compiled into bytecode, which is interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), making it flexible but relatively slower.</li>\n            <li>Java (JVM Runtime): Java source code is compiled into bytecode, which is verified and executed by the Java Runtime Environment (JVM). JVM uses an Interpreter and a JIT Compiler, making Java faster.</li>\n        </ul>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Engineering impact lost in translation?</h2>\n    <p>DevStats gives engineering leaders the shared language they need to align with business goals and prove impact without the endless back-and-forth. It helps to:\n        <ul>\n            <li>Show how dev work connects to business outcomes</li>\n            <li>Translate engineering metrics into exec-friendly insights</li>\n            <li>Spot bottlenecks early and keep delivery flowing</li>\n            <li>Prove your teamâ€™s value with every release</li>\n        </ul>\n    </p>\n    <h2>Design Patterns Cheat Sheet</h2>\n    <p>A cheat sheet that briefly explains each pattern and how to use it, including Factory, Builder, Prototype, Singleton, Chain of Responsibility, and many more.</p>\n    <h2>CI/CD Simplified Visual Guide</h2>\n    <p>Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice where code changes are frequently combined into a shared repository with automatic checks. Continuous Deployment (CD) automatically puts these code changes into real-world use. This visual guide helps to grasp and enhance software creation and delivery methods.</p>\n    <h2>How Apache Kafka Works?</h2>\n    <p>Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform. Producers publish data, which is serialized into bytes, partitioned, and published to a Kafka cluster. Brokers store partitions and replicate them. Consumers subscribe to topics and process data in real-time.</p>\n    <h2>Load Balancers vs API Gateways vs Reverse Proxy! And how can they Work Together?</h2>\n    <p>A client request hits an edge load balancer, which distributes traffic to the API Gateway. The API Gateway performs validations, authentication, authorization, and rate limiting. A reverse proxy within the gateway forwards the request to the correct service endpoint. Another load balancer distributes the request across multiple instances of the target microservice.</p>\n</body>","createdAt":"2025-09-13T15:31:25.000+00:00","link":"https://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep180-design-patterns-cheat-sheet","language":"ko"}
