{"content":"<body>\n  <p>Design career origin stories often sound clean and linear, but many designers have non-traditional paths. The author, after 15 years in fine dining, found that these \"detours\" built valuable skills like adaptability, anticipation, and grace under pressure, which are still crucial in design work.</p>\n  <p>Key lessons learned from fine dining and their application in design include:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Reading The Room: Understanding subtle cues from clients to anticipate needs and prevent misalignment, but being mindful not to over-complicate by intervening too early.</li>\n    <li>Speed Vs. Intentionality: Managing multiple tasks and shifting priorities from restaurant experience, while recognizing that in design, speed can sometimes hinder depth, requiring a more intentional approach.</li>\n    <li>Presentation Matters: Applying the importance of presentation from fine dining to how design concepts are framed and delivered, focusing on storytelling and connecting with the audience.</li>\n    <li>Composure Under Pressure: Maintaining composure and adaptability in high-pressure design situations, much like in a busy restaurant, to foster clarity and avoid impulsive reactions.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>The author encourages those with indirect design paths to identify their unique strengths and frame their background as an asset. Awareness of when these strengths might become blind spots is crucial for turning experience into a tool.</p>\n</body>","createdAt":"2025-08-13T20:06:14.690Z","language":"en"}
