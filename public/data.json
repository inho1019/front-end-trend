    "title": "What I Took From the State of Dev 2025 Survey",
    "content": "<p>State of Devs 2025 survey results are out! While the survey isn’t directly related to the <em>code</em> part of what we do for work, I do love the focus <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/\" rel=\"noopener\">Devographics</a> took <a href=\"https://survey.devographics.com/en-US\" rel=\"noopener\">ever since its inception in 2020</a>. And this year it brought us some rather <em>interesting</em> results through the attendance of 8,717 developers, lots of data, and even more useful insights that I think everyone can look up and learn from.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to look at the survey results with an analytical mindset, but wound up pouring my heart out because, well, I am a developer, and the entire survey affects me in a way. I have some personal opinions, it turns out. So, sit back, relax, and indulge me for a bit as we look at a few choice pieces of the survey.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And it’s worth noting that this is only <em>part one</em> of the survey results. A second data dump will be published later and I’m interested to poke at those numbers, too.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387980\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"an-opportunity-to-connect\">An opportunity to connect</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1497\" height=\"635\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-01.webp?resize=1497%2C635&ssl=1\" alt=\"Country or Region bar chart.

The majority of responses come from the U.S. (26%) but many other countries, including Italy, Germany, France, Estonia, Austria, South Africa and many more, account for the remaining 74%.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I mean, I am working and communicating with you right now, all the way from Nigeria! Isn’t that beautiful, to be able to communicate with people around the world through this wonderful place we call CSS-Tricks? And into the bigger community of developers that keeps it so fun?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I think this is a testament to how much we want to connect. More so,  the State of Devs survey gives us an opportunity to express our pain points on issues surrounding our experiences, workplace environments, quality of health, and even what hobbies we have as developers. And while I say <em>developers</em>, the survey makes it clear it’s more than that. Behind anyone’s face is someone encountering life challenges. We’re all people and people are capable of pure emotion. We are all just <em>human.</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>It’s also one of the reasons <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sunkanmifafowora.bsky.social\" rel=\"noopener\">I decided to open a Bluesky account</a>: to <em>connect</em> with more developers.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I think this survey offers insights into how much we care about ourselves in tech, and how eager we are to solve issues rarely talked about. And the fact that it’s global in nature illustrates how much in common we all have.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-women-participated-this-year\">More women participated this year</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1489\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-02.webp?resize=1489%2C550&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bar chart breaking down developers by gender.

I’d say 15% is still far too low to fairly “represent” an entire key segment of people, but it is certainly encouraging to see a greater slice in this particular survey. We need more women in this male-dominated industry.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"experience-over-talent-on-pay\">Experience over talent</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1475\" height=\"776\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=1475%2C776&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bar chart showing income ranges based on years of experience.\" class=\"wp-image-388013\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?w=1475&ssl=1 1475w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=300%2C158&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=1024%2C539&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=768%2C404&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to popular opinion, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/02/youre-not-paid-based-on-your-performance\" rel=\"noopener\">personal performance does not usually equate to higher pay</a>, and this is reflected in the results of this survey. It’s more like, the more experienced you are, the more you’re paid. But even that’s not the full story. If you’re new to the field, you still have to do some personal marketing, find and keep a mentor, and a whole bunch of stuff. Cassidy shares some nice insights on this in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zhFQtbWJFO4\" rel=\"noopener\">a video interview tracing her development career</a>. You should check it out, especially if you’re just starting out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Notice that the average income for those with 10-14 of experience ($115,833) is on par with those with between 15-29 years of experience ($118,000) and not far from those with 30+ years ($120,401). Experience appears to influence income, but perhaps not to the extent you would think, or else we’d see a wider gap between those with 15 years versus those with more than double the service time.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>More than that, notice how income for the most experienced developers (30+ years) is larger on <em>average</em> but the range of how much they make is lower than than those with 10-29 years under their belts. I’m curious what causes that decline. Is it a lack of keeping up with what’s new? Is it ageism? I’m sure there are lots of explanations.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lessons-i-learned-from-the-stats\">Salary, workplace, and job hunting</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I prefer not drill into each and every report. I’m interested in very specific areas that are covered in the survey. And what I take away from the survey is bound to be different than your takeaways, despite numbers being what they are. So, here are a few highlights of what stood out to me personally as I combed through the results.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your experience, employment status, and company’s employer count <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#years_of_experience\" rel=\"noopener\">seem to directly affect pay</a>. </strong>For example, full-timers report higher salaries than freelancers. I suppose that makes sense, but I doubt it provides the full picture because freelancers freelance for a number of reasons, whether its flexible hours, having more choice to choose their projects, or having personal constraints that limit how much they can work. In some ways, <a href=\"https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/ludics-guide-to-getting-software-engineering-jobs/\" rel=\"noopener\">freelancers are able to command higher pay while working less</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#career_issues\" rel=\"noopener\">Bad management and burnout seem to be the most talked-about</a> issues in the workplace.</strong> Be on guard during interviews, look up reviews about the company you’re about to work for, and make sure there are far fewer complaints than accolades. Make sure you’re not being too worked up during work hours; <a href=\"https://www.ciphr.com/blog/regular-breaks-at-work#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Wellbeing%20Thesis,a%20more%20sustainable%20work%20routine.\" rel=\"noopener\">breaks are essential for a boost in productivity</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#discrimination_issues\" rel=\"noopener\">Seventy percent of folks reported <em>no</em> discrimination in the workplace</a>,</strong> which means we’re perhaps doing something right. That said, it’s still disheartening that 30% experience some form of discrimination and lowering that figure is something we ought to aim for. I’m hoping companies — particularly the tech giants in our space — take note of this and enforce laws and policies surrounding this. Still, we can always call out discriminatory behavior and make corrections where necessary. And who’s to say that everyone who answered the survey felt safe sharing that sort of thing? <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/combating-workplace-challenges-silence-enemy-sylvia-lafair-ereuf/\" rel=\"noopener\">Silence can be the enemy of progress.</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Never get too comfortable in your job.</strong> Although <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#laid_off\" rel=\"noopener\">69% report having never been laid off</a>, I still think that job security is brittle in this space. Always learn, build, and if possible, try to look for other sources of income. Layoffs are <em>still</em> happening, and looking at the news, it’s likely to continue for the foreseeable future, with the <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#laid_off\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S., Australia, and U.K. being leading the way</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One number that jumped off the page for me is that <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/workplace/#job_finding_application_count\" rel=\"noopener\">it takes an average of four applications for most developers to find a new job</a>.</strong> This bamboozles me. I’m looking for a full-time role (yes, I’m available!), and I regularly apply for more than four jobs in a given day. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, but that’s also not consistent with those in my social and professional circles. I know and see plenty of people who are working hard to find work, and the number of jobs they apply for has to bring that number up. Four applications seems way low, though I don’t have the quantitative proof for it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your personal network is still the best way to find a job.</strong> We will always and forever be <em>social animals,</em> and I think that’s why most survey participants say that coworker relationships are the greatest perk of a job. I find this to be true with my work here at CSS-Tricks. I get to collaborate with other like-minded CSS and front-end enthusiasts far and wide. I’ve developed close relationships with the editors and other writers, and that’s something I value more than any other benefits I could get somewhere else.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Compensation is still a top workplace challenge.</strong> JavaScript is still the king of programming (bias alert), taking the top spot as the most popular programming language. I know you’re interested, that CSS came in at third.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To my surprise, <strong>Bluesky is more popular amongst developers than X</strong>. I didn’t realize how much toxicity I’ve been exposed to at X until <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sunkanmifafowora.bsky.social\" rel=\"noopener\">I opened a Bluesky account</a>. I hate saying that the “engagement” is better, or some buzz-worthy thing like that, but I do experience more actual discussions over at Bluesky than I have for a long time at X. And many of you report the same. I hasten to say that Bluesky is a direct replacement for what X (let’s face it, Twitter) used to be, but it seems we at least have a better alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"health-is-wealth\">Health issues</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1542\" height=\"755\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-04.webp?resize=1542%2C755&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bar chart showing health issues.

    "title": "What I Took From the State of Dev 2025 Survey",
    "content": "<p>State of Devs 2025 survey results are out! While the survey isn’t directly related to the <em>code</em> part of what we do for work, I do love the focus <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/\" rel=\"noopener\">Devographics</a> took <a href=\"https://survey.devographics.com/en-US\" rel=\"noopener\">ever since its inception in 2020</a>. And this year it brought us some rather <em>interesting</em> results through the attendance of 8,717 developers, lots of data, and even more useful insights that I think everyone can look up and learn from.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I decided to look at the survey results with an analytical mindset, but wound up pouring my heart out because, well, I am a developer, and the entire survey affects me in a way. I have some personal opinions, it turns out. So, sit back, relax, and indulge me for a bit as we look at a few choice pieces of the survey.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And it’s worth noting that this is only <em>part one</em> of the survey results. A second data dump will be published later and I’m interested to poke at those numbers, too.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387980\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"an-opportunity-to-connect\">An opportunity to connect</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1497\" height=\"635\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-01.webp?resize=1497%2C635&ssl=1\" alt=\"Country or Region bar chart.

The majority of responses come from the U.S. (26%) but many other countries, including Italy, Germany, France, Estonia, Austria, South Africa and many more, account for the remaining 74%.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I mean, I am working and communicating with you right now, all the way from Nigeria! Isn’t that beautiful, to be able to communicate with people around the world through this wonderful place we call CSS-Tricks? And into the bigger community of developers that keeps it so fun?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I think this is a testament to how much we want to connect. More so,  the State of Devs survey gives us an opportunity to express our pain points on issues surrounding our experiences, workplace environments, quality of health, and even what hobbies we have as developers. And while I say <em>developers</em>, the survey makes it clear it’s more than that. Behind anyone’s face is someone encountering life challenges. We’re all people and people are capable of pure emotion. We are all just <em>human.</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>It’s also one of the reasons <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sunkanmifafowora.bsky.social\" rel=\"noopener\">I decided to open a Bluesky account</a>: to <em>connect</em> with more developers.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I think this survey offers insights into how much we care about ourselves in tech, and how eager we are to solve issues rarely talked about. And the fact that it’s global in nature illustrates how much in common we all have.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-women-participated-this-year\">More women participated this year</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1489\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-02.webp?resize=1489%2C550&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bar chart breaking down developers by gender.

I’d say 15% is still far too low to fairly “represent” an entire key segment of people, but it is certainly encouraging to see a greater slice in this particular survey. We need more women in this male-dominated industry.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"experience-over-talent-on-pay\">Experience over talent</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1475\" height=\"776\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=1475%2C776&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bar chart showing income ranges based on years of experience.\" class=\"wp-image-388013\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?w=1475&ssl=1 1475w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=300%2C158&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=1024%2C539&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=768%2C404&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to popular opinion, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/02/youre-not-paid-based-on-your-performance\" rel=\"noopener\">personal performance does not usually equate to higher pay</a>, and this is reflected in the results of this survey. It’s more like, the more experienced you are, the more you’re paid. But even that’s not the full story. If you’re new to the field, you still have to do some personal marketing, find and keep a mentor, and a whole bunch of stuff. Cassidy shares some nice insights on this in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zhFQtbWJFO4\" rel=\"noopener\">a video interview tracing her development career</a>. You should check it out, especially if you’re just starting out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Notice that the average income for those with 10-14 of experience ($115,833) is on par with those with between 15-29 years of experience ($118,000) and not far from those with 30+ years ($120,401). Experience appears to influence income, but perhaps not to the extent you would think, or else we’d see a wider gap between those with 15 years versus those with more than double the service time.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>More than that, notice how income for the most experienced developers (30+ years) is larger on <em>average</em> but the range of how much they make is lower than than those with 10-29 years under their belts. I’m curious what causes that decline. Is it a lack of keeping up with what’s new? Is it ageism? I’m sure there are lots of explanations.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lessons-i-learned-from-the-stats\">Salary, workplace, and job hunting</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I prefer not drill into each and every report. I’m interested in very specific areas that are covered in the survey. And what I take away from the survey is bound to be different than your takeaways, despite numbers being what they are. So, here are a few highlights of what stood out to me personally as I combed through the results.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your experience, employment status, and company’s employer count <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#years_of_experience\" rel=\"noopener\">seem to directly affect pay</a>. </strong>For example, full-timers report higher salaries than freelancers. I suppose that makes sense, but I doubt it provides the full picture because freelancers freelance for a number of reasons, whether its flexible hours, having more choice to choose their projects, or having personal constraints that limit how much they can work. In some ways, <a href=\"https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/ludics-guide-to-getting-software-engineering-jobs/\" rel=\"noopener\">freelancers are able to command higher pay while working less</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#career_issues\" rel=\"noopener\">Bad management and burnout seem to be the most talked-about</a> issues in the workplace.</strong> Be on guard during interviews, look up reviews about the company you’re about to work for, and make sure there are far fewer complaints than accolades. Make sure you’re not being too worked up during work hours; <a href=\"https://www.ciphr.com/blog/regular-breaks-at-work#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Wellbeing%20Thesis,a%20more%20sustainable%20work%20routine.\" rel=\"noopener\">breaks are essential for a boost in productivity</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#discrimination_issues\" rel=\"noopener\">Seventy percent of folks reported <em>no</em> discrimination in the workplace</a>,</strong> which means we’re perhaps doing something right. That said, it’s still disheartening that 30% experience some form of discrimination and lowering that figure is something we ought to aim for. I’m hoping companies — particularly the tech giants in our space — take note of this and enforce laws and policies surrounding this. Still, we can always call out discriminatory behavior and make corrections where necessary. And who’s to say that everyone who answered the survey felt safe sharing that sort of thing? <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/combating-workplace-challenges-silence-enemy-sylvia-lafair-ereuf/\" rel=\"noopener\">Silence can be the enemy of progress.</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Never get too comfortable in your job.</strong> Although <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#laid_off\" rel=\"noopener\">69% report having never been laid off</a>, I still think that job security is brittle in this space. Always learn, build, and if possible, try to look for other sources of income. Layoffs are <em>still</em> happening, and looking at the news, it’s likely to continue for the foreseeable future, with the <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#laid_off\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S., Australia, and U.K. being leading the way</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One number that jumped off the page for me is that <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/workplace/#job_finding_application_count\" rel=\"noopener\">it takes an average of four applications for most developers to find a new job</a>.</strong> This bamboozles me. I’m looking for a full-time role (yes, I’m available!), and I regularly apply for more than four jobs in a given day. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, but that’s also not consistent with those in my social and professional circles. I know and see plenty of people who are working hard to find work, and the number of jobs they apply for has to bring that number up. Four applications seems way low, though I don’t have the quantitative proof for it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your personal network is still the best way to find a job.</strong> We will always and forever be <em>social animals,</em> and I think that’s why most survey participants say that coworker relationships are the greatest perk of a job. I find this to be true with my work here at CSS-Tricks. I get to collaborate with other like-minded CSS and front-end enthusiasts far and wide. I’ve developed close relationships with the editors and other writers, and that’s something I value more than any other benefits I could get somewhere else.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Compensation is still a top workplace challenge.</strong> JavaScript is still the king of programming (bias alert), taking the top spot as the most popular programming language. I know you’re interested, that CSS came in at third.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To my surprise, <strong>Bluesky is more popular amongst developers than X</strong>. I didn’t realize how much toxicity I’ve been exposed to at X until <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sunkanmifafowora.bsky.social\" rel=\"noopener\">I opened a Bluesky account</a>. I hate saying that the “engagement” is better, or some buzz-worthy thing like that, but I do experience more actual discussions over at Bluesky than I have for a long time at X. And many of you report the same. I hasten to say that Bluesky is a direct replacement for what X (let’s face it, Twitter) used to be, but it seems we at least have a better alternative.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"health-is-wealth\">Health issues</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1542\" height=\"755\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-04.webp?resize=1542%2C755&ssl=1\" alt=\"Bar chart showing health issues.

    "title": "Setting Line Length in CSS (and Fitting Text to a Container)",
    "content": "<p>First, what is line length? <dfn>Line length</dfn> is the length of a container that holds a body of multi-line text. “Multi-line” is the key part here, because text becomes less readable if the beginning of a line of text is too far away from the end of the prior line of text. This causes users to reread lines by mistake, and generally get lost while reading.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) gives us a pretty hard rule to follow: <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation\" rel=\"noopener\">no more than 80 characters on a line</a> (40 if the language is Chinese, Japanese, or Korean), which is super easy to implement using character (<code>ch</code>) units:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">width: 80ch;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The width of <code>1ch</code> is equal to the width of the number <code>0</code> in your chosen font, so the exact width depends on the font.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387679\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"setting-the-optimal-line-length\">Setting the <em>optimal</em> line length</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Just because you’re allowed up to 80 characters on a line, it doesn’t mean that you <em>have</em> to aim for that number. A study by the <a href=\"https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability\" rel=\"noopener\">Baymard Institute</a> revealed that a line length of 50-75 characters is the optimal length — this takes into consideration that smaller line lengths mean more lines and, therefore, more opportunities for users to make reading mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, we also have responsive design to think about, so setting a minimum width (e.g., <code>min-width: 50ch</code>) isn’t a good idea because you’re unlikely to fit 50 characters on a line with, for example, a screen/window size that is 320 pixels wide. So, there’s a bit of nuance involved, and the best way to handle that is by combining the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/c/clamp/\"><code>clamp()</code></a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/min/\"><code>min()</code></a> functions:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong><code>clamp()</code>:</strong> Set a fluid value that’s relative to a container using percentage, viewport, or container query units, but with minimum and maximum constraints.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong><code>min()</code>:</strong> Set the smallest value from a list of comma-separated values.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s start with <code>min()</code>. One of the arguments is <code>93.75vw</code>. Assuming that the container extends across the whole viewport, this’d equal <code>300px</code> when the viewport width is <code>320px</code> (allowing for <code>20px</code> of spacing to be distributed as you see fit) and <code>1350px</code> when the viewport width is <code>1440px</code>. However, for as long as the other argument (<code>50ch</code>) is the smallest of the two values, that’s the value that <code>min()</code> will resolve to.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">min(93.75vw, 50ch);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next is <code>clamp()</code>, which accepts three arguments in the following order: the minimum, preferred, and maximum values. This is how we’ll set the line length.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For the minimum, you’d plug in your <code>min()</code> function, which sets the <code>50ch</code> line length but only conditionally. For the maximum, I suggest <code>75ch</code>, as mentioned before. The preferred value is totally up to you — this will be the width of your container when not hitting the minimum or maximum.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">width: clamp(min(93.75vw, 50ch), 70vw, 75ch);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, you can use <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/min/\"><code>min()</code></a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/max/\"><code>max()</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-calc-in-css/\"><code>calc()</code></a> in any of those arguments to add further nuance.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If the container feels too narrow, then the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-size/\"><code>font-size</code></a> might be too large. If it feels too wide, then the <code>font-size</code> might be too small.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fit-text-to-container-with-javascript-\">Fit text to container (with JavaScript)</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You know that design trend where text is made to fit the width of a container? Typically, to utilize as much of the available space as possible? You’ll often see it applied to headings on marketing pages and blog posts. Well, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/fitting-text-to-a-container/\">Chris wrote about it</a> back in 2018, rounding up several ways to achieve the effect with JavaScript or jQuery, unfortunately with limitations. However, the ending reveals that you can just use SVG as long as you know the <code>viewBox</code> values, and I actually have a trick for getting them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Although it still requires 3-5 lines of JavaScript, it’s the shortest method I’ve found. It also slides into HTML and CSS perfectly, particularly since the SVG inherits many CSS properties (including the color, thanks to <code>fill: currentColor</code>):</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_XJbYjpJ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/XJbYjpJ?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=XJbYjpJ&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed XJbYjpJ\" title=\"CodePen Embed XJbYjpJ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><h1 class=\"container\">\r\n  <svg>\r\n    <text>Fit text to container</text>\r\n  </svg>\r\n</h1></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">h1.container {\r\n  /* Container size */\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n\r\n  /* Type styles (<text> will inherit most of them) */\r\n  font: 900 1em system-ui;\r\n  color: hsl(43 74% 3%);\r\n\r\n  text {\r\n    /*\r\n      We have to use fill: instead of color: here\r\n      But we can use currentColor to inherit the color\r\n    */\r\n    fill: currentColor;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Select all SVGs */\r\nconst svg = document.querySelectorAll(\"svg\");\r\n\r\n/* Loop all SVGs */\r\nsvg.forEach(element => {\r\n  /* Get bounding box of <text> element */\r\n  const bbox = element.querySelector(\"text\").getBBox();\r\n  /* Apply bounding box values to SVG element as viewBox */\r\n  element.setAttribute(\"viewBox\", [bbox.x, bbox.y, bbox.width, bbox.height].join(\" \"));\r\n});</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fit-text-to-container-pure-css-\">Fit text to container (pure CSS)</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re hell-bent on a pure-CSS method, you <em>are</em> in luck. However, despite the insane things that we can do with CSS these days, <a href=\"https://kizu.dev/fit-to-width/\" rel=\"noopener\">Roman Komarov’s fit-to-width hack</a> is a bit complicated (albeit rather impressive). Here’s the gist of it:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>The text is duplicated a couple of times (although hidden accessibly with <code>aria-hidden</code> and hidden literally with <code>visibility: hidden</code>) so that we can do math with the hidden ones, and then apply the result to the visible one.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Using container queries/container query units, the math involves dividing the inline size of the text by the inline size of the container to get a scaling factor, which we then use on the visible text’s <code>font-size</code> to make it grow or shrink.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>To make the scaling factor unitless, we use the <a href=\"https://dev.to/janeori/css-type-casting-to-numeric-tanatan2-scalars-582j\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>tan(atan2())</code> type-casting trick</a>.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Certain custom properties must be registered using the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/p/property/\"><code>@property</code></a> at-rule (otherwise they don’t work as intended).</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The final <code>font-size</code> value utilizes <code>clamp()</code> to set minimum and maximum font sizes, but these are optional.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><span class=\"text-fit\">\r\n  <span>\r\n    <span class=\"text-fit\">\r\n      <span><span>fit-to-width text</span></span>\r\n      <span aria-hidden=\"true\">fit-to-width text</span>\r\n    </span>\r\n  </span>\r\n  <span aria-hidden=\"true\">fit-to-width text</span>\r\n</span></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.text-fit {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  container-type: inline-size;\r\n\r\n  --captured-length: initial;\r\n  --support-sentinel: var(--captured-length, 9999px);\r\n\r\n  & > [aria-hidden] {\r\n    visibility: hidden;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  & > :not([aria-hidden]) {\r\n    flex-grow: 1;\r\n    container-type: inline-size;\r\n\r\n    --captured-length: 100cqi;\r\n    --available-space: var(--captured-length);\r\n\r\n    & > * {\r\n      --support-sentinel: inherit;\r\n      --captured-length: 100cqi;\r\n      --ratio: tan(\r\n        atan2(\r\n          var(--available-space),\r\n          var(--available-space) - var(--captured-length)\r\n        )\r\n      );\r\n      --font-size: clamp(\r\n        1em,\r\n        1em * var(--ratio),\r\n        var(--max-font-size, infinity * 1px) - var(--support-sentinel)\r\n      );\r\n      inline-size: var(--available-space);\r\n\r\n      &:not(.text-fit) {\r\n        display: block;\r\n        font-size: var(--font-size);\r\n\r\n        @container (inline-size > 0) {\r\n          white-space: nowrap;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      /* Necessary for variable fonts that use optical sizing */\r\n      &.text-fit {\r\n        --captured-length2: var(--font-size);\r\n        font-variation-settings: \"opsz\" tan(atan2(var(--captured-length2), 1px));\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@property --captured-length {\r\n  syntax: \"<length>\";\r\n  initial-value: 0px;\r\n  inherits: true;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@property --captured-length2 {\r\n  syntax: \"<length>\";\r\n  initial-value: 0px;\r\n  inherits: true;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_GgJPVWa\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/GgJPVWa?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=GgJPVWa&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed GgJPVWa\" title=\"CodePen Embed GgJPVWa\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"watch-for-new-text-grow-text-shrink-properties\">Watch for new <code>text-grow</code>/<code>text-shrink</code> properties</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To make fitting text to a container possible in just <em>one</em> line of CSS, <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2528\" rel=\"noopener\">a number of solutions have been discussed</a>. The favored solution seems to be two new <a href=\"https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/css-fit-text/blob/main/README.md#potential-solution\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>text-grow</code> and <code>text-shrink</code> properties</a>. Personally, I don’t think we need two different properties. In fact, I prefer the simpler alternative, <a href=\"https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/css-fit-text/blob/main/README.md#considered-alternatives\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>font-size: fit-width</code></a>, but since <code>text-grow</code> and <code>text-shrink</code> are already on the table (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/I3aG24t4bwI/m/xLBLyAJKDwAJ\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrome intends to prototype</a> and you can <a href=\"https://chromestatus.com/feature/5104141688635392?gate=5084590997504000\" rel=\"noopener\">track it</a>), let’s take a look at how they could work.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing that you need to know is that, as proposed, the <code>text-grow</code> and <code>text-shrink</code> properties can apply to multiple lines of wrapped text within a container, and that’s huge because we can’t do that with my JavaScript technique or Roman’s CSS technique (where each line needs to have its own container).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Both have the same syntax, and you’ll need to use both if you want to allow both growing <em>and</em> shrinking:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">text-grow: <fit-target> <fit-method>? <length>?;\r\ntext-shrink: <fit-target> <fit-method>? <length>?;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong><code><fit-target></code></strong>\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>per-line</code>: For <code>text-grow</code>, lines of text shorter than the container will grow to fit it. For <code>text-shrink</code>, lines of text <em>longer</em> than the container will <em>shrink</em> to fit it.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>consistent</code>: For <code>text-grow</code>, the shortest line will grow to fit the container while all other lines grow by the same scaling factor.

    "title": "Setting Line Length in CSS (and Fitting Text to a Container)",
    "content": "<p>First, what is line length? <dfn>Line length</dfn> is the length of a container that holds a body of multi-line text. “Multi-line” is the key part here, because text becomes less readable if the beginning of a line of text is too far away from the end of the prior line of text. This causes users to reread lines by mistake, and generally get lost while reading.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) gives us a pretty hard rule to follow: <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation\" rel=\"noopener\">no more than 80 characters on a line</a> (40 if the language is Chinese, Japanese, or Korean), which is super easy to implement using character (<code>ch</code>) units:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">width: 80ch;</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The width of <code>1ch</code> is equal to the width of the number <code>0</code> in your chosen font, so the exact width depends on the font.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387679\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"setting-the-optimal-line-length\">Setting the <em>optimal</em> line length</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Just because you’re allowed up to 80 characters on a line, it doesn’t mean that you <em>have</em> to aim for that number. A study by the <a href=\"https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability\" rel=\"noopener\">Baymard Institute</a> revealed that a line length of 50-75 characters is the optimal length — this takes into consideration that smaller line lengths mean more lines and, therefore, more opportunities for users to make reading mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, we also have responsive design to think about, so setting a minimum width (e.g., <code>min-width: 50ch</code>) isn’t a good idea because you’re unlikely to fit 50 characters on a line with, for example, a screen/window size that is 320 pixels wide. So, there’s a bit of nuance involved, and the best way to handle that is by combining the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/c/clamp/\"><code>clamp()</code></a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/min/\"><code>min()</code></a> functions:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong><code>clamp()</code>:</strong> Set a fluid value that’s relative to a container using percentage, viewport, or container query units, but with minimum and maximum constraints.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong><code>min()</code>:</strong> Set the smallest value from a list of comma-separated values.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s start with <code>min()</code>. One of the arguments is <code>93.75vw</code>. Assuming that the container extends across the whole viewport, this’d equal <code>300px</code> when the viewport width is <code>320px</code> (allowing for <code>20px</code> of spacing to be distributed as you see fit) and <code>1350px</code> when the viewport width is <code>1440px</code>. However, for as long as the other argument (<code>50ch</code>) is the smallest of the two values, that’s the value that <code>min()</code> will resolve to.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">min(93.75vw, 50ch);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next is <code>clamp()</code>, which accepts three arguments in the following order: the minimum, preferred, and maximum values. This is how we’ll set the line length.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For the minimum, you’d plug in your <code>min()</code> function, which sets the <code>50ch</code> line length but only conditionally. For the maximum, I suggest <code>75ch</code>, as mentioned before. The preferred value is totally up to you — this will be the width of your container when not hitting the minimum or maximum.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">width: clamp(min(93.75vw, 50ch), 70vw, 75ch);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, you can use <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/min/\"><code>min()</code></a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/max/\"><code>max()</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-calc-in-css/\"><code>calc()</code></a> in any of those arguments to add further nuance.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If the container feels too narrow, then the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-size/\"><code>font-size</code></a> might be too large. If it feels too wide, then the <code>font-size</code> might be too small.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fit-text-to-container-with-javascript-\">Fit text to container (with JavaScript)</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You know that design trend where text is made to fit the width of a container? Typically, to utilize as much of the available space as possible? You’ll often see it applied to headings on marketing pages and blog posts. Well, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/fitting-text-to-a-container/\">Chris wrote about it</a> back in 2018, rounding up several ways to achieve the effect with JavaScript or jQuery, unfortunately with limitations. However, the ending reveals that you can just use SVG as long as you know the <code>viewBox</code> values, and I actually have a trick for getting them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Although it still requires 3-5 lines of JavaScript, it’s the shortest method I’ve found. It also slides into HTML and CSS perfectly, particularly since the SVG inherits many CSS properties (including the color, thanks to <code>fill: currentColor</code>):</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_XJbYjpJ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/XJbYjpJ?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=XJbYjpJ&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed XJbYjpJ\" title=\"CodePen Embed XJbYjpJ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><h1 class=\"container\">\r\n  <svg>\r\n    <text>Fit text to container</text>\r\n  </svg>\r\n</h1></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">h1.container {\r\n  /* Container size */\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n\r\n  /* Type styles (<text> will inherit most of them) */\r\n  font: 900 1em system-ui;\r\n  color: hsl(43 74% 3%);\r\n\r\n  text {\r\n    /*\r\n      We have to use fill: instead of color: here\r\n      But we can use currentColor to inherit the color\r\n    */\r\n    fill: currentColor;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Select all SVGs */\r\nconst svg = document.querySelectorAll(\"svg\");\r\n\r\n/* Loop all SVGs */\r\nsvg.forEach(element => {\r\n  /* Get bounding box of <text> element */\r\n  const bbox = element.querySelector(\"text\").getBBox();\r\n  /* Apply bounding box values to SVG element as viewBox */\r\n  element.setAttribute(\"viewBox\", [bbox.x, bbox.y, bbox.width, bbox.height].join(\" \"));\r\n});</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fit-text-to-container-pure-css-\">Fit text to container (pure CSS)</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re hell-bent on a pure-CSS method, you <em>are</em> in luck.

    "title": "Scroll-Driven Sticky Heading",
    "content": "<p>Scroll-driven animations are great! They’re a powerful tool that lets developers tie the movement and transformation of elements directly to the user’s scroll position. This technique opens up new ways to create interactive experiences, cuing images to appear, text to glide across the stage, and backgrounds to subtly shift. Used thoughtfully, scroll-driven animations (SDA) can make your website feel more dynamic, engaging, and responsive.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A few weeks back, I was playing around with scroll-driven animations, just searching for all sorts of random things you could do with it. That’s when I came up with the idea to animate the text of the main heading (<code>h1</code>) and, using SDA, change the heading itself based on the user’s scroll position on the page. In this article, we’re going to break down that idea and rebuild it step by step. This is the general direction we’ll be heading in, which looks better <a href=\"https://codepen.io/amit_sheen/full/jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f\" rel=\"noopener\">in full screen</a> and viewed in a Chromium browser:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387748\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f\" title=\"CodePen Embed jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It’s important to note that the effect in this example only works in browsers that support scroll-driven animations. Where SDA isn’t supported, there’s a proper fallback to static headings. From an accessibility perspective, if the browser has reduced motion enabled or if the page is being accessed with assistive technology, the effect is disabled and the user gets all the content in a fully semantic and accessible way.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<baseline-status class=\"wp-block-css-tricks-baseline-status\" featureId=\"scroll-driven-animations\"></baseline-status>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Just a quick note:</strong> this approach does rely on a few <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/\">“magic numbers”</a> for the keyframes, which we’ll talk about later on. While they’re surprisingly responsive, this method is really best suited for static content, and it’s not ideal for highly dynamic websites.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"closer-look-at-the-animation\">Closer Look at the Animation</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before we dive into scroll-driven animations, let’s take a minute to look at the text animation itself, and how it actually works. This is based on an idea I had a few years back when I wanted to create a typewriter effect. At the time, most of the methods I found involved animating the element’s width, required using a monospace font, or a solid color background. None of which really worked for me. So I looked for a way to animate the content itself, and the solution was, as it often is, in pseudo-elements.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_YzZYoMV\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/YzZYoMV?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=YzZYoMV&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed YzZYoMV\" title=\"CodePen Embed YzZYoMV\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pseudo-elements have a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/content/\"><code>content</code></a> property, and you can (kind of) animate that text. It’s not exactly animation, but you can change the content dynamically. The cool part is that the only thing that changes is the text itself, no other tricks required.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"start-with-a-solid-foundation\">Start With a Solid Foundation</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you know the trick behind the text animation, let’s see how to combine it with a scroll-driven animation, and make sure we have a solid, accessible fallback as well.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll start with some basic semantic markup. I’ll wrap everything in a <code>main</code> element, with individual sections inside. Each <code>section</code> gets its own heading and content, like text and images. For this example, I’ve set up four sections, each with a bit of text and some images, all about Primary Colors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><main>\r\n  <section>\r\n    <h1>Primary Colors</h1>\r\n    <p>The three primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) form the basis of all other colors on the color wheel. Mixing them in different combinations produces a wide array of hues.</p>\r\n    <img src=\"./colors.jpg\" alt=\"...image description\">\r\n  </section>\r\n  \r\n  <section>\r\n    <h2>Red Power</h2>\r\n    <p>Red is a bold and vibrant color, symbolizing energy, passion, and warmth. It easily attracts attention and is often linked with strong emotions.</p>\r\n    <img src=\"./red.jpg\" alt=\"...image description\">\r\n  </section>\r\n  \r\n  <section>\r\n    <h2>Blue Calm</h2>\r\n    <p>Blue is a calm and cool color, representing tranquility, stability, and trust. It evokes images of the sky and sea, creating a peaceful mood.</p>\r\n    <img src=\"./blue.jpg\" alt=\"...image description\">\r\n  </section>\r\n  \r\n  <section>\r\n    <h2>Yellow Joy</h2>\r\n    <p>Yellow is a bright and cheerful color, standing for light, optimism, and creativity. It is highly visible and brings a sense of happiness and hope.</p>\r\n    <img src=\"./yellow.jpg\" alt=\"...image description\">\r\n  </section>\r\n</main></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As for the styling, I’m not doing anything special at this stage, just the basics. I changed the font and adjusted the text and heading sizes, set up the <code>display</code> for the <code>main</code> and the <code>section</code>s, and fixed the image sizes with <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/\"><code>object-fit</code></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_jEPJpae/e3738ab413075fe51fb3cf9fde711f37\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/jEPJpae/e3738ab413075fe51fb3cf9fde711f37?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=jEPJpae/e3738ab413075fe51fb3cf9fde711f37&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed jEPJpae/e3738ab413075fe51fb3cf9fde711f37\" title=\"CodePen Embed jEPJpae/e3738ab413075fe51fb3cf9fde711f37\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, at this point, we have a simple site with static, semantic, and accessible content, which is great. Now the goal is to make sure it stays that way as we start adding our effect.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-second-first-heading\">The Second First Heading</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll start by adding another <code>h1</code> element at the top of the <code>main</code>. This new element will serve as the placeholder for our animated text, updating according to the user’s scroll position. And yes, I know there’s already an <code>h1</code> in the first <code>section</code>; that’s fine and we’ll address it in a moment so that only one is accessible at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><h1 class=\"scrollDrivenHeading\" aria-hidden=\"true\">Primary Colors</h1></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Notice that I’ve added <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> to this heading, so it won’t be picked up by screen readers. Now I can add a class specifically for screen readers, <code>.srOnly</code>, to all the other headings. This way, anyone viewing the content “normally” will see only the animated heading, while assistive technology users will get the regular, static semantic headings.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_YPXgjLV/1efdda6b4f7f38b0a20f63fc1dc85de1\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/YPXgjLV/1efdda6b4f7f38b0a20f63fc1dc85de1?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=YPXgjLV/1efdda6b4f7f38b0a20f63fc1dc85de1&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed YPXgjLV/1efdda6b4f7f38b0a20f63fc1dc85de1\" title=\"CodePen Embed YPXgjLV/1efdda6b4f7f38b0a20f63fc1dc85de1\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Note:</strong> The style for the <code>.srOnly</code> class is based on <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html\" rel=\"noopener\">“Inclusively Hidden”</a> by Scott O’Hara.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"handling-support\">Handling Support</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As much as accessibility matters, there’s another concern we need to keep in mind: support. CSS Scroll-Driven Animations are fantastic, but they’re still not fully supported everywhere. That’s why it’s important to provide the static version for browsers that don’t support SDA.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The first step is to hide the animated heading we just added using <code>display: none</code>. Then, we’ll add a new <code>@supports</code> block to check for SDA support. Inside that block, where SDA is supported, we can change back the display for the heading.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>.srOnly</code> class should also move into the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/s/supports/\"><code>@supports</code></a> block, since we only want it to apply when the effect is active, not when it’s not supported. This way, just like with assistive technology, anyone visiting the page in a browser without SDA support will still get the static content.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.scrollDrivenHeading {\r\n  display: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {\r\n  .scrollDrivenHeading {\r\n    display: block;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  /* Screen Readers Only */\r\n  .srOnly {\r\n    clip: rect(0 0 0 0); \r\n    clip-path: inset(50%);\r\n    height: 1px;\r\n    overflow: hidden;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    white-space: nowrap; \r\n    width: 1px;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"get-sticky\">Get Sticky</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The next thing we need to do is handle the stickiness of the heading. To make sure the heading always stays on screen, we’ll set its <code>position</code> to <code>sticky</code> with <code>top: 0</code> so it sticks to the top of the viewport.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While we’re at it, let’s add some basic styling, including a background so the text doesn’t blend with whatever’s behind the heading, a bit of <code>padding</code> for spacing, and <code>white-space: nowrap</code> to keep the heading on a single line.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* inside the @supports block */\r\n.scrollDrivenHeading {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  position: sticky;\r\n  top: 0;\r\n  background-image: linear-gradient(0deg, transparent, black 1em);\r\n  padding: 0.5em 0.25em;\r\n  white-space: nowrap;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now everything’s set up: in normal conditions, we’ll see a single sticky heading at the top of the page. And if someone uses assistive technology or a browser that doesn’t support SDA, they’ll still get the regular static content.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_raVRrXO/57d0bf10192daf4d22eeadd50290c09f\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/raVRrXO/57d0bf10192daf4d22eeadd50290c09f?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=raVRrXO/57d0bf10192daf4d22eeadd50290c09f&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed raVRrXO/57d0bf10192daf4d22eeadd50290c09f\" title=\"CodePen Embed raVRrXO/57d0bf10192daf4d22eeadd50290c09f\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now we’re ready to start animating the text. <em>Almost…</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-magic-numbers\">The Magic Numbers</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To build the text animation, we need to know exactly where the text should change. With SDA, scrolling basically becomes our timeline, and we have to determine the exact points on that timeline to trigger the animation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To make this easier, and to help you pinpoint those positions, I’ve prepared the following script:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@property --scroll-position {\r\n  syntax: \"<number>\";\r\n  inherits: false;\r\n  initial-value: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody::after {\r\n  counter-reset: sp var(--scroll-position);\r\n  content: counter(sp) \"%\";\r\n  position: fixed;\r\n  top: 0;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  padding: 1em;\r\n  background-color: maroon;\r\n  animation: scrollPosition steps(100);\r\n  animation-timeline: scroll();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@keyframes scrollPosition {\r\n  0% { --scroll-position: 0; }\r\n  100% { --scroll-position: 100; }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don’t want to get too deep into this code, but the idea is to take the same scroll timeline we’ll use next to animate the text, and use it to animate a custom property (<code>--scroll-position</code>) from <code>0</code> to <code>100</code> based on the scroll progress, and display that value in the content.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If we’ll add this at the start of our code, we’ll see a small red square in the top-left corner of the screen, showing the current scroll position as a percentage (to match the keyframes). This way, you can scroll to any section you want and easily mark the percentage where each heading should begin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_MYwxqvy/e8b735e3d6bb7e94ff8cf192b07745c8\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/MYwxqvy/e8b735e3d6bb7e94ff8cf192b07745c8?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=MYwxqvy/e8b735e3d6bb7e94ff8cf192b07745c8&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed MYwxqvy/e8b735e3d6bb7e94ff8cf192b07745c8\" title=\"CodePen Embed MYwxqvy/e8b735e3d6bb7e94ff8cf192b07745c8\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With this method and a bit of trial and error, I found that I want the headings to change at 30%, 60%, and 90%. So, how do we actually do it? Let’s start animating.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"animating-text\">Animating Text</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First, we’ll clear out the content inside the <code>.scrollDrivenHeading</code> element so it’s empty and ready for dynamic content. In the CSS, I’ll add a pseudo-element to the heading, which we’ll use to animate the text. We’ll give it empty <code>content</code>, set up the <code>animation-name</code>, and of course, assign the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation-timeline/\"><code>animation-timeline</code></a> to <code>scroll()</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And since I’m animating the <code>content</code> property, which is a discrete type, it doesn’t transition smoothly between values. It just jumps from one to the next. By setting the <code>animation-timing-function</code> property to <code>step-end</code>, I make sure each change happens exactly at the keyframe I define, so the text switches precisely where I want it to, instead of somewhere in between.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.scrollDrivenHeading {\r\n  /* style */\r\n\r\n  &::after {\r\n    content: '';\r\n    animation-name: headingContent;\r\n    animation-timing-function: step-end;\r\n    animation-timeline: scroll();\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As for the keyframes, this part is pretty straightforward (for now). We’ll set the first frame (<code>0%</code>) to the first heading, and assign the other headings to the percentages we found earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@keyframes headingContent {\r\n  0% { content: 'Primary Colors'}\r\n  30% { content: 'Red Power'}\r\n  60% { content: 'Blue Calm'}\r\n  90%, 100% { content: 'Yellow Joy'}\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, now we’ve got a site with a sticky heading that updates as you scroll.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_QwboVVb/cc46fc3a918fe0abb888a2c8e5b07f4f\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/QwboVVb/cc46fc3a918fe0abb888a2c8e5b07f4f?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=QwboVVb/cc46fc3a918fe0abb888a2c8e5b07f4f&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed QwboVVb/cc46fc3a918fe0abb888a2c8e5b07f4f\" title=\"CodePen Embed QwboVVb/cc46fc3a918fe0abb888a2c8e5b07f4f\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But wait, right now it just switches instantly. Where’s the animation?! Here’s where it gets interesting. Since we’re not using JavaScript or any string manipulation, we have to write the keyframes ourselves. The best approach is to start from the target heading you want to reach, and build backwards. So, if you want to animate between the first and second heading, it would look like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@keyframes headingContent {\r\n  0% { content: 'Primary Colors'}\r\n  \r\n  9% { content: 'Primary Color'}\r\n  10% { content: 'Primary Colo'}\r\n  11% { content: 'Primary Col'}\r\n  12% { content: 'Primary Co'}\r\n  13% { content: 'Primary C'}\r\n  14% { content: 'Primary '}\r\n  15% { content: 'Primary'}\r\n  16% { content: 'Primar'}\r\n  17% { content: 'Prima'}\r\n  18% { content: 'Prim'}\r\n  19% { content: 'Pri'}\r\n  20% { content: 'Pr'}\r\n  21% { content: 'P'}\r\n  \r\n  22% { content: 'R'}\r\n  23% { content: 'Re'}\r\n  24% { content: 'Red'}\r\n  25% { content: 'Red '}\r\n  26% { content: 'Red P'}\r\n  27% { content: 'Red Po'}\r\n  28%{ content: 'Red Pow'}\r\n  29% { content: 'Red Powe'}\r\n  \r\n  30% { content: 'Red Power'}\r\n  60% { content: 'Blue Calm'}\r\n  90%, 100% { content: 'Yellow Joy'}\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I simply went back by 1% each time, removing or adding a letter as needed. Note that in other cases, you might want to use a different step size, and not always 1%. For example, on longer headings with more words, you’ll probably want smaller steps.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If we repeat this process for all the other headings, we’ll end up with a fully animated heading.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_xbGBQjw/082c77f0af7e46ce7fb8791bc4a35664\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/xbGBQjw/082c77f0af7e46ce7fb8791bc4a35664?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=xbGBQjw/082c77f0af7e46ce7fb8791bc4a35664&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed xbGBQjw/082c77f0af7e46ce7fb8791bc4a35664\" title=\"CodePen Embed xbGBQjw/082c77f0af7e46ce7fb8791bc4a35664\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"user-preferences\">User Preferences</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We talked before about accessibility and making sure the content works well with assistive technology, but there’s one more thing you should keep in mind: <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/m/media/prefers-reduced-motion/\"><code>prefers-reduced-motion</code></a>. Even though this isn’t a strict WCAG requirement for this kind of animation, it can make a big difference for people with vestibular sensitivities, so it’s a good idea to offer a way to show the content without animations.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to provide a non-animated alternative, all you need to do is wrap your <code>@supports</code> block with a <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> query:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\r\n  @supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {\r\n    /* style */\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leveling-up\">Leveling Up</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s talk about variations. In the previous example, we animated the entire heading text, but we don’t have to do that. You can animate just the part you want, and use additional animations to enhance the effect and make things more interesting. For example, here I kept the text “Primary Color” fixed, and added a <code>span</code> after it that handles the animated text.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><h1 class=\"scrollDrivenHeading\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n  Primary Color<span></span>\r\n</h1></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And since I now have a separate <code>span</code>, I can also animate its color to match each value.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_jEPJdQa/2cd985ecfaafb73261b071d33d425970\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/jEPJdQa/2cd985ecfaafb73261b071d33d425970?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=jEPJdQa/2cd985ecfaafb73261b071d33d425970&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed jEPJdQa/2cd985ecfaafb73261b071d33d425970\" title=\"CodePen Embed jEPJdQa/2cd985ecfaafb73261b071d33d425970\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the next example, I kept the text animation on the <code>span</code>, but instead of changing the text color, I added another scroll-driven animation on the heading itself to change its background color.

    "content": "<p>Scroll-driven animations are great! They’re a powerful tool that lets developers tie the movement and transformation of elements directly to the user’s scroll position. This technique opens up new ways to create interactive experiences, cuing images to appear, text to glide across the stage, and backgrounds to subtly shift. Used thoughtfully, scroll-driven animations (SDA) can make your website feel more dynamic, engaging, and responsive.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A few weeks back, I was playing around with scroll-driven animations, just searching for all sorts of random things you could do with it. That’s when I came up with the idea to animate the text of the main heading (<code>h1</code>) and, using SDA, change the heading itself based on the user’s scroll position on the page. In this article, we’re going to break down that idea and rebuild it step by step. This is the general direction we’ll be heading in, which looks better <a href=\"https://codepen.io/amit_sheen/full/jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f\" rel=\"noopener\">in full screen</a> and viewed in a Chromium browser:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387748\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f\" title=\"CodePen Embed jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It’s important to note that the effect in this example only works in browsers that support scroll-driven animations. Where SDA isn’t supported, there’s a proper fallback to static headings. From an accessibility perspective, if the browser has reduced motion enabled or if the page is being accessed with assistive technology, the effect is disabled and the user gets all the content in a fully semantic and accessible way.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<baseline-status class=\"wp-block-css-tricks-baseline-status\" featureId=\"scroll-driven-animations\"></baseline-status>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Just a quick note:</strong> this approach does rely on a few <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/\">“magic numbers”</a> for the keyframes, which we’ll talk about later on. While they’re surprisingly responsive, this method is really best suited for static content, and it’s not ideal for highly dynamic websites.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"closer-look-at-the-animation\">Closer Look at the Animation</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before we dive into scroll-driven animations, let’s take a minute to look at the text animation itself, and how it actually works. This is based on an idea I had a few years back when I wanted to create a typewriter effect. At the time, most of the methods I found involved animating the element’s width, required using a monospace font, or a solid color background. None of which really worked for me. So I looked for a way to animate the content itself, and the solution was, as it often is, in pseudo-elements.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_YzZYoMV\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/YzZYoMV?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=YzZYoMV&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed YzZYoMV\" title=\"CodePen Embed YzZYoMV\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pseudo-elements have a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/content/\"><code>content</code></a> property, and you can (kind of) animate that text. It’s not exactly animation, but you can change the content dynamically. The cool part is that the only thing that changes is the text itself, no other tricks required.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"start-with-a-solid-foundation\">Start With a Solid Foundation</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you know the trick behind the text animation, let’s see how to combine it with a scroll-driven animation, and make sure we have a solid, accessible fallback as well.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll start with some basic semantic markup. I’ll wrap everything in a <code>main</code> element, with individual sections inside. Each <code>section</code> gets its own heading and content, like text and images. For this example, I’ve set up four sections, each with a bit of text and some images, all about Primary Colors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><main>\r\n  <section>\r\n    <h1>Primary Colors</h1>\r\n    <p>The three primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) form the basis of all other colors on the color wheel. Mixing them in different combinations produces a wide array of hues.</p>\r\n    <img src=\"./colors.jpg\" alt=\"...image description\">\r\n  </section>\r\n  \r\n  <section>\r\n    <h2>Red Power</h2>\r\n    <p>Red is a bold and vibrant color, symbolizing energy, passion, and warmth. It easily attracts attention and is often linked with strong emotions.</p>\r\n    <img src=\"./red.jpg\" alt=\"...image description\">\r\n  </section>\r\n  \r\n  <section>\r\n    <h2>Blue Calm</h2>\r\n    <p>Blue is a calm and cool color, representing tranquility, stability, and trust. It evokes images of the sky and sea, creating a peaceful mood.</p>\r\n    <img src=\"./blue.jpg\" alt=\"...image description\">\r\n  </section>\r\n  \r\n  <section>\r\n    <h2>Yellow Joy</h2>\r\n    <p>Yellow is a bright and cheerful color, standing for light, optimism, and creativity. It is highly visible and brings a sense of happiness and hope.</p>\r\n    <img src=\"./yellow.jpg\" alt=\"...image description\">\r\n  </section>\r\n</main></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As for the styling, I’m not doing anything special at this stage, just the basics. I changed the font and adjusted the text and heading sizes, set up the <code>display</code> for the <code>main</code> and the <code>section</code>s, and fixed the image sizes with <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/\"><code>object-fit</code></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_jEPJpae/e3738ab413075fe51fb3cf9fde711f37\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/jEPJpae/e3738ab413075fe51fb3cf9fde711f37?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=jEPJpae/e3738ab413075fe51fb3cf9fde711f37&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed jEPJpae/e3738ab413075fe51fb3cf9fde711f37\" title=\"CodePen Embed jEPJpae/e3738ab413075fe51fb3cf9fde711f37\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, at this point, we have a simple site with static, semantic, and accessible content, which is great. Now the goal is to make sure it stays that way as we start adding our effect.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-second-first-heading\">The Second First Heading</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll start by adding another <code>h1</code> element at the top of the <code>main</code>. This new element will serve as the placeholder for our animated text, updating according to the user’s scroll position. And yes, I know there’s already an <code>h1</code> in the first <code>section</code>; that’s fine and we’ll address it in a moment so that only one is accessible at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><h1 class=\"scrollDrivenHeading\" aria-hidden=\"true\">Primary Colors</h1></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Notice that I’ve added <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> to this heading, so it won’t be picked up by screen readers. Now I can add a class specifically for screen readers, <code>.srOnly</code>, to all the other headings. This way, anyone viewing the content “normally” will see only the animated heading, while assistive technology users will get the regular, static semantic headings.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_YPXgjLV/1efdda6b4f7f38b0a20f63fc1dc85de1\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/YPXgjLV/1efdda6b4f7f38b0a20f63fc1dc85de1?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=YPXgjLV/1efdda6b4f7f38b0a20f63fc1dc85de1&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed YPXgjLV/1efdda6b4f7f38b0a20f63fc1dc85de1\" title=\"CodePen Embed YPXgjLV/1efdda6b4f7f38b0a20f63fc1dc85de1\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Note:</strong> The style for the <code>.srOnly</code> class is based on <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html\" rel=\"noopener\">“Inclusively Hidden”</a> by Scott O’Hara.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"handling-support\">Handling Support</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As much as accessibility matters, there’s another concern we need to keep in mind: support. CSS Scroll-Driven Animations are fantastic, but they’re still not fully supported everywhere. That’s why it’s important to provide the static version for browsers that don’t support SDA.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The first step is to hide the animated heading we just added using <code>display: none</code>. Then, we’ll add a new <code>@supports</code> block to check for SDA support. Inside that block, where SDA is supported, we can change back the display for the heading.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>.srOnly</code> class should also move into the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/s/supports/\"><code>@supports</code></a> block, since we only want it to apply when the effect is active, not when it’s not supported. This way, just like with assistive technology, anyone visiting the page in a browser without SDA support will still get the static content.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.scrollDrivenHeading {\r\n  display: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {\r\n  .scrollDrivenHeading {\r\n    display: block;\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  /* Screen Readers Only */\r\n  .srOnly {\r\n    clip: rect(0 0 0 0); \r\n    clip-path: inset(50%);\r\n    height: 1px;\r\n    overflow: hidden;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    white-space: nowrap; \r\n    width: 1px;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"get-sticky\">Get Sticky</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The next thing we need to do is handle the stickiness of the heading. To make sure the heading always stays on screen, we’ll set its <code>position</code> to <code>sticky</code> with <code>top: 0</code> so it sticks to the top of the viewport.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While we’re at it, let’s add some basic styling, including a background so the text doesn’t blend with whatever’s behind the heading, a bit of <code>padding</code> for spacing, and <code>white-space: nowrap</code> to keep the heading on a single line.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* inside the @supports block */\r\n.scrollDrivenHeading {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  position: sticky;\r\n  top: 0;\r\n  background-image: linear-gradient(0deg, transparent, black 1em);\r\n  padding: 0.5em 0.25em;\r\n  white-space: nowrap;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now everything’s set up: in normal conditions, we’ll see a single sticky heading at the top of the page. And if someone uses assistive technology or a browser that doesn’t support SDA, they’ll still get the regular static content.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_raVRrXO/57d0bf10192daf4d22eeadd50290c09f\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/raVRrXO/57d0bf10192daf4d22eeadd50290c09f?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=raVRrXO/57d0bf10192daf4d22eeadd50290c09f&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed raVRrXO/57d0bf10192daf4d22eeadd50290c09f\" title=\"CodePen Embed raVRrXO/57d0bf10192daf4d22eeadd50290c09f\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now we’re ready to start animating the text. <em>Almost…</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-magic-numbers\">The Magic Numbers</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To build the text animation, we need to know exactly where the text should change. With SDA, scrolling basically becomes our timeline, and we have to determine the exact points on that timeline to trigger the animation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To make this easier, and to help you pinpoint those positions, I’ve prepared the following script:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@property --scroll-position {\r\n  syntax: \"<number>\";\r\n  inherits: false;\r\n  initial-value: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nbody::after {\r\n  counter-reset: sp var(--scroll-position);\r\n  content: counter(sp) \"%\";\r\n  position: fixed;\r\n  top: 0;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  padding: 1em;\r\n  background-color: maroon;\r\n  animation: scrollPosition steps(100);\r\n  animation-timeline: scroll();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@keyframes scrollPosition {\r\n  0% { --scroll-position: 0; }\r\n  100% { --scroll-position: 100; }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don’t want to get too deep into this code, but the idea is to take the same scroll timeline we’ll use next to animate the text, and use it to animate a custom property (<code>--scroll-position</code>) from <code>0</code> to <code>100</code> based on the scroll progress, and display that value in the content.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If we’ll add this at the start of our code, we’ll see a small red square in the top-left corner of the screen, showing the current scroll position as a percentage (to match the keyframes). This way, you can scroll to any section you want and easily mark the percentage where each heading should begin.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_MYwxqvy/e8b735e3d6bb7e94ff8cf192b07745c8\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/MYwxqvy/e8b735e3d6bb7e94ff8cf192b07745c8?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=MYwxqvy/e8b735e3d6bb7e94ff8cf192b07745c8&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed MYwxqvy/e8b735e3d6bb7e94ff8cf192b07745c8\" title=\"CodePen Embed MYwxqvy/e8b735e3d6bb7e94ff8cf192b07745c8\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With this method and a bit of trial and error, I found that I want the headings to change at 30%, 60%, and 90%. So, how do we actually do it? Let’s start animating.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"animating-text\">Animating Text</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First, we’ll clear out the content inside the <code>.scrollDrivenHeading</code> element so it’s empty and ready for dynamic content. In the CSS, I’ll add a pseudo-element to the heading, which we’ll use to animate the text. We’ll give it empty <code>content</code>, set up the <code>animation-name</code>, and of course, assign the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation-timeline/\"><code>animation-timeline</code></a> to <code>scroll()</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And since I’m animating the <code>content</code> property, which is a discrete type, it doesn’t transition smoothly between values. It just jumps from one to the next. By setting the <code>animation-timing-function</code> property to <code>step-end</code>, I make sure each change happens exactly at the keyframe I define, so the text switches precisely where I want it to, instead of somewhere in between.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.scrollDrivenHeading {\r\n  /* style */\r\n\r\n  &::after {\r\n    content: '';\r\n    animation-name: headingContent;\r\n    animation-timing-function: step-end;\r\n    animation-timeline: scroll();\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As for the keyframes, this part is pretty straightforward (for now). We’ll set the first frame (<code>0%</code>) to the first heading, and assign the other headings to the percentages we found earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@keyframes headingContent {\r\n  0% { content: 'Primary Colors'}\r\n  30% { content: 'Red Power'}\r\n  60% { content: 'Blue Calm'}\r\n  90%, 100% { content: 'Yellow Joy'}\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, now we’ve got a site with a sticky heading that updates as you scroll.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_QwboVVb/cc46fc3a918fe0abb888a2c8e5b07f4f\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/QwboVVb/cc46fc3a918fe0abb888a2c8e5b07f4f?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=QwboVVb/cc46fc3a918fe0abb888a2c8e5b07f4f&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed QwboVVb/cc46fc3a918fe0abb888a2c8e5b07f4f\" title=\"CodePen Embed QwboVVb/cc46fc3a918fe0abb888a2c8e5b07f4f\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But wait, right now it just switches instantly. Where’s the animation?! Here’s where it gets interesting. Since we’re not using JavaScript or any string manipulation, we have to write the keyframes ourselves. The best approach is to start from the target heading you want to reach, and build backwards. So, if you want to animate between the first and second heading, it would look like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@keyframes headingContent {\r\n  0% { content: 'Primary Colors'}\r\n  \r\n  9% { content: 'Primary Color'}\r\n  10% { content: 'Primary Colo'}\r\n  11% { content: 'Primary Col'}\r\n  12% { content: 'Primary Co'}\r\n  13% { content: 'Primary C'}\r\n  14% { content: 'Primary '}\r\n  15% { content: 'Primary'}\r\n  16% { content: 'Primar'}\r\n  17% { content: 'Prima'}\r\n  18% { content: 'Prim'}\r\n  19% { content: 'Pri'}\r\n  20% { content: 'Pr'}\r\n  21% { content: 'P'}\r\n  \r\n  22% { content: 'R'}\r\n  23% { content: 'Re'}\r\n  24% { content: 'Red'}\r\n  25% { content: 'Red '}\r\n  26% { content: 'Red P'}\r\n  27% { content: 'Red Po'}\r\n  28%{ content: 'Red Pow'}\r\n  29% { content: 'Red Powe'}\r\n  \r\n  30% { content: 'Red Power'}\r\n  60% { content: 'Blue Calm'}\r\n  90%, 100% { content: 'Yellow Joy'}\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I simply went back by 1% each time, removing or adding a letter as needed. Note that in other cases, you might want to use a different step size, and not always 1%. For example, on longer headings with more words, you’ll probably want smaller steps.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If we repeat this process for all the other headings, we’ll end up with a fully animated heading.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_xbGBQjw/082c77f0af7e46ce7fb8791bc4a35664\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/xbGBQjw/082c77f0af7e46ce7fb8791bc4a35664?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=xbGBQjw/082c77f0af7e46ce7fb8791bc4a35664&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed xbGBQjw/082c77f0af7e46ce7fb8791bc4a35664\" title=\"CodePen Embed xbGBQjw/082c77f0af7e46ce7fb8791bc4a35664\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"user-preferences\">User Preferences</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We talked before about accessibility and making sure the content works well with assistive technology, but there’s one more thing you should keep in mind: <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/m/media/prefers-reduced-motion/\"><code>prefers-reduced-motion</code></a>. Even though this isn’t a strict WCAG requirement for this kind of animation, it can make a big difference for people with vestibular sensitivities, so it’s a good idea to offer a way to show the content without animations.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to provide a non-animated alternative, all you need to do is wrap your <code>@supports</code> block with a <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> query:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\r\n  @supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {\r\n    /* style */\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leveling-up\">Leveling Up</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s talk about variations. In the previous example, we animated the entire heading text, but we don’t have to do that. You can animate just the part you want, and use additional animations to enhance the effect and make things more interesting. For example, here I kept the text “Primary Color” fixed, and added a <code>span</code> after it that handles the animated text.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><h1 class=\"scrollDrivenHeading\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\r\n  Primary Color<span></span>\r\n</h1></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And since I now have a separate <code>span</code>, I can also animate its color to match each value.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_jEPJdQa/2cd985ecfaafb73261b071d33d425970\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/jEPJdQa/2cd985ecfaafb73261b071d33d425970?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=jEPJdQa/2cd985ecfaafb73261b071d33d425970&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed jEPJdQa/2cd985ecfaafb73261b071d33d425970\" title=\"CodePen Embed jEPJdQa/2cd985ecfaafb73261b071d33d425970\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the next example, I kept the text animation on the <code>span</code>, but instead of changing the text color, I added another scroll-driven animation on the heading itself to change its background color. This way, you can add as many animations as you want and change whatever you like.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_XJbQbyP/11cd48be7ff3c71f77a2883b129a121b\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/XJbQbyP/11cd48be7ff3c71f77a2883b129a121b?height=550&theme-id=1&slug-hash=XJbQbyP/11cd48be7ff3c71f77a2883b129a121b&default-tab=result\" height=\"550\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed XJbQbyP/11cd48be7ff3c71f77a2883b129a121b\" title=\"CodePen Embed XJbQbyP/11cd48be7ff3c71f77a2883b129a121b\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"your-turn-\">Your Turn!</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>CSS Scroll-Driven Animations are more than just a cool trick; they’re a game-changer that opens the door to a whole new world of web design.

    "content": "<p>This is the fourth post in a series about the new CSS <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/shape/\"><code>shape()</code></a> function. So far, we’ve covered the most common commands you will use to draw various shapes, including lines, arcs, and curves. This time, I want to introduce you to two more commands: <code>close</code> and <code>move</code>. They’re fairly simple in practice, and I think you will rarely use them, but they are incredibly useful when you need them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387613\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-group ticss-ad1a3c1b\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"better-css-shapes-using-shape\">Better CSS Shapes Using <code>shape()</code></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">Lines and Arcs</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-2-more-on-arcs/\">More on Arcs</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-3-curves/\">Curves</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Close and Move (you are here!)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-close-command\">The <code>close</code> command</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">the first part</a>, we said that <code>shape()</code> always starts with a <code>from</code> command to define the first starting point but what about the end? It should end with a <code>close</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>But you never used any <code>close</code> command in the previous articles!?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s true. I never did because I either “close” the shape myself or rely on the browser to “close” it for me. Said like that, it’s a bit confusing, but let’s take a simple example to better understand:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(from 0 0, line to 100% 0, line to 100% 100%) </code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you try this code, you will get a triangle shape, but if you look closely, you will notice that we have only two line commands whereas, to draw a triangle, we need a total of three lines. The last line between <code>100% 100%</code> and <code>0 0</code> is implicit, and that’s the part where the browser is closing the shape for me without having to explicitly use a <code>close</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I could have written the following:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(from 0 0, line to 100% 0, line to 100% 100%, close)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Or instead, define the last line by myself:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(from 0 0, line to 100% 0, line to 100% 100%, line to 0 0)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But since the browser is able to close the shape alone, there is no need to add that last <code>line</code> command nor do we need to explicitly add the <code>close</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This might lead you to think that the <code>close</code> command is useless, right? It’s true in most cases (after all, I have written three articles about <code>shape()</code> without using it), but it’s important to know about it and what it does. In some particular cases, it can be useful, especially if used in the middle of a shape.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_KwpxGEp/aef0671d5c808480d3257cadbcdda568\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/KwpxGEp/aef0671d5c808480d3257cadbcdda568?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=KwpxGEp/aef0671d5c808480d3257cadbcdda568&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed KwpxGEp/aef0671d5c808480d3257cadbcdda568\" title=\"CodePen Embed KwpxGEp/aef0671d5c808480d3257cadbcdda568\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this example, my starting point is the center and the logic of the shape is to draw four triangles. In the process, I need to get back to the center each time. So, instead of writing <code>line to center</code>, I simply write <code>close</code> and the browser will automatically get back to the initial point!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Intuitively, we should write the following:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape( \r\n  from center, \r\n  line to 20%  0,   hline by 60%, line to center, /* triangle 1 */\r\n  line to 100% 20%, vline by 60%, line to center, /* triangle 2 */\r\n  line to 20% 100%, hline by 60%, line to center, /* triangle 3 */\r\n  line to 0   20%,  vline by 60% /* triangle 4 */\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But we can optimize it a little and simply do this instead:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape( \r\n  from center, \r\n  line to 20%  0,   hline by 60%, close,\r\n  line to 100% 20%, vline by 60%, close,\r\n  line to 20% 100%, hline by 60%, close,\r\n  line to 0    20%, vline by 60%\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We write less code, sure, but another important thing is that if I update the <code>center</code> value with another position, <strong>the</strong> <code>close</code> <strong>command will follow that position</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_Kwpbvma/25e24292ffd49924981d4897dca2fb79\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/Kwpbvma/25e24292ffd49924981d4897dca2fb79?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=Kwpbvma/25e24292ffd49924981d4897dca2fb79&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed Kwpbvma/25e24292ffd49924981d4897dca2fb79\" title=\"CodePen Embed Kwpbvma/25e24292ffd49924981d4897dca2fb79\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t forget about this trick. It can help you optimize a lot of shapes by writing less code.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-move-command\">The <code>move</code> command</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s turn our attention to another <code>shape()</code> command you may rarely use, but can be incredibly useful in certain situations: the <code>move</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Most times when we need to draw a shape, it’s actually <em>one continuous shape</em>. But it may happen that our shape is composed of different parts not linked together. In these situations, the <code>move</code> command is what you will need.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s take an example, similar to the previous one, but this time the triangles don’t touch each other:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvgYeb/6eb4d145ead0b3c000ff1bb8b903ed4c\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvgYeb/6eb4d145ead0b3c000ff1bb8b903ed4c?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvgYeb/6eb4d145ead0b3c000ff1bb8b903ed4c&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvgYeb/6eb4d145ead0b3c000ff1bb8b903ed4c\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvgYeb/6eb4d145ead0b3c000ff1bb8b903ed4c\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Intuitively, we may think we need four separate elements, with its own <code>shape()</code> definition. But the that example is a single shape!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The trick is to draw the first triangle, then “move” somewhere else to draw the next one, and so on. The <code>move</code> command is similar to the <code>from</code> command but we use it in the middle of <code>shape()</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(\r\n  from    50% 40%, line to 20%  0,   hline by 60%, close, /* triangle 1 */\r\n  move to 60% 50%, line to 100% 20%, vline by 60%, close, /* triangle 2 */\r\n  move to 50% 60%, line to 20% 100%, hline by 60%, close, /* triangle 3 */\r\n  move to 40% 50%, line to 0   20%,  vline by 60% /* triangle 4 */\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After drawing the first triangle, we “close” it and “move” to a new point to draw the next triangle. We can have multiple shapes using a single <code>shape()</code> definition. A more generic code will look like the below:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(\r\n  from    X1 Y1, ..., close, /* shape 1 */\r\n  move to X2 Y2, ..., close, /* shape 2 */\r\n  ...\r\n  move to Xn Yn, ... /* shape N */\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>close</code> commands before the <code>move</code> commands aren’t mandatory, so the code can be simplified to this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(\r\n  from    X1 Y1, ..., /* shape 1 */\r\n  move to X2 Y2, ..., /* shape 2 */\r\n  ...\r\n  move to Xn Yn, ... /* shape N */\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvYPBL/fad2cc952270358a11425d6f3cded1e2\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvYPBL/fad2cc952270358a11425d6f3cded1e2?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvYPBL/fad2cc952270358a11425d6f3cded1e2&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvYPBL/fad2cc952270358a11425d6f3cded1e2\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvYPBL/fad2cc952270358a11425d6f3cded1e2\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s look at a few interesting use cases where this technique can be helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cut-out-shapes\">Cut-out shapes</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, I shared a trick on <a href=\"https://css-tip.com/cut-out-shapes/\" rel=\"noopener\">how to create cut-out shapes</a> using <code>clip-path: polygon()</code>. Starting from any kind of polygon, we can easily invert it to get its cut-out version:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gOJvdav\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/gOJvdav?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=gOJvdav&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gOJvdav\" title=\"CodePen Embed gOJvdav\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can do the same using <code>shape()</code>. The idea is to have an intersection between the main shape and the rectangle shape that fits the element boundaries. We need two shapes, hence the need for the <code>move</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The code is as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.shape {\r\n  clip-path: shape(from ...., move to 0 0, hline to 100%, vline to 100%, hline to 0);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You start by creating your main shape and then you “move” to <code>0 0</code> and you create the rectangle shape (Remember, It’s the first shape we create in <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/#aa-rectangle\">the first part of this series</a>). We can even go further and introduce a CSS variable to easily switch between the normal shape and the inverted one.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.shape {\r\n  clip-path: shape(from .... var(--i,));\r\n}\r\n.invert {\r\n  --i:,move to 0 0, hline to 100%, vline to 100%, hline to 0;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>By default, <code>--i</code> is not defined so <code>var(--i,)</code>will be empty and we get the main shape. If we define the variable with the rectangle shape, we get the inverted version.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here is an example using a rounded hexagon shape:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvYWNr/2586e5e748c02e41dec139ccdbc22971\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvYWNr/2586e5e748c02e41dec139ccdbc22971?height=700&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvYWNr/2586e5e748c02e41dec139ccdbc22971&default-tab=result\" height=\"700\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvYWNr/2586e5e748c02e41dec139ccdbc22971\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvYWNr/2586e5e748c02e41dec139ccdbc22971\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, the code should be as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.shape {\r\n  clip-path: shape(evenodd from .... var(--i,));\r\n}\r\n.invert {\r\n  --i:,move to 0 0, hline to 100%, vline to 100%, hline to 0;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Notice the <code>evenodd</code> I am adding at the beginning of <code>shape()</code>. I won’t bother you with a detailed explanation on what it does but in some cases, the inverted shape is not visible and the fix is to add <code>evenodd</code> at the beginning. You can check <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/fill-rule\" rel=\"noopener\">the MDN page for more details</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another improvement we can do is to add a variable to control the space around the shape. Let’s suppose you want to make the hexagon shape of the previous example smaller. It‘s tedious to update the code of the hexagon but it’s easier to update the code of the rectangle shape.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.shape {\r\n  clip-path: shape(evenodd from ... var(--i,)) content-box;\r\n}\r\n.invert {\r\n  --d: 20px;\r\n  padding: var(--d);\r\n  --i: ,move to calc(-1*var(--d)) calc(-1*var(--d)),\r\n        hline to calc(100% + var(--d)),\r\n        vline to calc(100% + var(--d)),\r\n        hline to calc(-1*var(--d));\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We first update the reference box of the shape to be <code>content-box</code>. Then we add some padding which will logically reduce the area of the shape since it will no longer include the padding (nor the border). The padding is excluded (invisible) by default and here comes the trick where we update the rectangle shape to re-include the padding.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That is why the <code>--i</code> variable is so verbose. It uses the value of the padding to extend the rectangle area and cover the whole element as if we didn’t have <code>content-box</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvYWRG/b409a57e82d07eb39c5e9d667b7a708c\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvYWRG/b409a57e82d07eb39c5e9d667b7a708c?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvYWRG/b409a57e82d07eb39c5e9d667b7a708c&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvYWRG/b409a57e82d07eb39c5e9d667b7a708c\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvYWRG/b409a57e82d07eb39c5e9d667b7a708c\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Not only you can easily invert any kind of shape, but you can also control the space around it! Here is another demo using the CSS-Tricks logo to illustrate how easy the method is:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_PwqxMaN/6e8c6ea82dd95d7282fadb85894e245c\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/PwqxMaN/6e8c6ea82dd95d7282fadb85894e245c?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=PwqxMaN/6e8c6ea82dd95d7282fadb85894e245c&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed PwqxMaN/6e8c6ea82dd95d7282fadb85894e245c\" title=\"CodePen Embed PwqxMaN/6e8c6ea82dd95d7282fadb85894e245c\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This exact same example is available in my <a href=\"https://css-generators.com/svg-to-css/\" rel=\"noopener\">SVG-to-CSS converter</a>, providing you with the <code>shape()</code> code without having to do all of the math.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"repetitive-shapes\">Repetitive shapes</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another interesting use case of the <code>move</code> command is when we need to repeat the same shape multiple times. Do you remember the difference between the <code>by</code> and the <code>to</code> directives? The <code>by</code> directive allows us to define relative coordinates considering the previous point. So, if we create our shape using only <code>by</code>, we can easily reuse the same code as many times as we want.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s start with a simple example of a circle shape:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(from X Y, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Starting from <code>X Y</code>, I draw a first arc moving upward by <code>50px</code>, then I get back to <code>X Y</code> with another arc using the same offset, but downward. If you are a bit lost with the syntax, try reviewing <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">Part 1</a> to refresh your memory about the <code>arc</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>How I drew the shape is not important. What is important is that whatever the value of <code>X Y</code> is, I will always get the same circle but in a different position. Do you see where I am going with this idea? If I want to add another circle, I simply repeat the same code with a different <code>X Y</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(\r\n  from    X1 Y1, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%,\r\n  move to X2 Y2, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And since the code is the same, I can store the circle shape into a CSS variable and draw as many circles as I want:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.shape {\r\n  --sh:, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%;\r\n  \r\n  clip-path: shape(\r\n    from    X1 Y1 var(--sh),\r\n    move to X2 Y2 var(--sh),\r\n    ... \r\n    move to Xn Yn var(--sh)\r\n  ) \r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You don’t want a circle? Easy, you can update the <code>--sh</code> variable with any shape you want. Here is an example with three different shapes:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_MYwZgEL/97583111b04d9aeb8d850ea02ea49289\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/MYwZgEL/97583111b04d9aeb8d850ea02ea49289?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=MYwZgEL/97583111b04d9aeb8d850ea02ea49289&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed MYwZgEL/97583111b04d9aeb8d850ea02ea49289\" title=\"CodePen Embed MYwZgEL/97583111b04d9aeb8d850ea02ea49289\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And guess what? You can invert the whole thing using the cut-out technique by adding the rectangle shape at the end:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_ByNEgVw/94fc702f01d47459f7a89a22644cf27d\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/ByNEgVw/94fc702f01d47459f7a89a22644cf27d?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=ByNEgVw/94fc702f01d47459f7a89a22644cf27d&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed ByNEgVw/94fc702f01d47459f7a89a22644cf27d\" title=\"CodePen Embed ByNEgVw/94fc702f01d47459f7a89a22644cf27d\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This code is a perfect example of the <code>shape()</code> function’s power. We don’t have any code duplication and we can simply adjust the shape with CSS variables. This is something we are unable to achieve with the <code>path()</code> function because it doesn’t support variables.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s all for this fourth installment of our series on the CSS <code>shape()</code> function! We didn’t make any super complex shapes, but we learned how two simple commands can open a lot of possibilities of what can be done using <code>shape()</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Just for fun, here is one more demo recreating a classic <a href=\"https://css-tip.com/dots-loader/\" rel=\"noopener\">three-dot loader</a> using the last technique we covered.

    "content": "<p>This is the fourth post in a series about the new CSS <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/shape/\"><code>shape()</code></a> function. So far, we’ve covered the most common commands you will use to draw various shapes, including lines, arcs, and curves. This time, I want to introduce you to two more commands: <code>close</code> and <code>move</code>. They’re fairly simple in practice, and I think you will rarely use them, but they are incredibly useful when you need them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387613\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-group ticss-ad1a3c1b\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"better-css-shapes-using-shape\">Better CSS Shapes Using <code>shape()</code></h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">Lines and Arcs</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-2-more-on-arcs/\">More on Arcs</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-3-curves/\">Curves</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Close and Move (you are here!)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-close-command\">The <code>close</code> command</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">the first part</a>, we said that <code>shape()</code> always starts with a <code>from</code> command to define the first starting point but what about the end? It should end with a <code>close</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>But you never used any <code>close</code> command in the previous articles!?</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s true. I never did because I either “close” the shape myself or rely on the browser to “close” it for me. Said like that, it’s a bit confusing, but let’s take a simple example to better understand:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(from 0 0, line to 100% 0, line to 100% 100%) </code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you try this code, you will get a triangle shape, but if you look closely, you will notice that we have only two line commands whereas, to draw a triangle, we need a total of three lines. The last line between <code>100% 100%</code> and <code>0 0</code> is implicit, and that’s the part where the browser is closing the shape for me without having to explicitly use a <code>close</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I could have written the following:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(from 0 0, line to 100% 0, line to 100% 100%, close)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Or instead, define the last line by myself:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(from 0 0, line to 100% 0, line to 100% 100%, line to 0 0)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But since the browser is able to close the shape alone, there is no need to add that last <code>line</code> command nor do we need to explicitly add the <code>close</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This might lead you to think that the <code>close</code> command is useless, right? It’s true in most cases (after all, I have written three articles about <code>shape()</code> without using it), but it’s important to know about it and what it does. In some particular cases, it can be useful, especially if used in the middle of a shape.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_KwpxGEp/aef0671d5c808480d3257cadbcdda568\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/KwpxGEp/aef0671d5c808480d3257cadbcdda568?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=KwpxGEp/aef0671d5c808480d3257cadbcdda568&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed KwpxGEp/aef0671d5c808480d3257cadbcdda568\" title=\"CodePen Embed KwpxGEp/aef0671d5c808480d3257cadbcdda568\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this example, my starting point is the center and the logic of the shape is to draw four triangles. In the process, I need to get back to the center each time. So, instead of writing <code>line to center</code>, I simply write <code>close</code> and the browser will automatically get back to the initial point!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Intuitively, we should write the following:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape( \r\n  from center, \r\n  line to 20%  0,   hline by 60%, line to center, /* triangle 1 */\r\n  line to 100% 20%, vline by 60%, line to center, /* triangle 2 */\r\n  line to 20% 100%, hline by 60%, line to center, /* triangle 3 */\r\n  line to 0   20%,  vline by 60% /* triangle 4 */\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But we can optimize it a little and simply do this instead:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape( \r\n  from center, \r\n  line to 20%  0,   hline by 60%, close,\r\n  line to 100% 20%, vline by 60%, close,\r\n  line to 20% 100%, hline by 60%, close,\r\n  line to 0    20%, vline by 60%\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We write less code, sure, but another important thing is that if I update the <code>center</code> value with another position, <strong>the</strong> <code>close</code> <strong>command will follow that position</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_Kwpbvma/25e24292ffd49924981d4897dca2fb79\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/Kwpbvma/25e24292ffd49924981d4897dca2fb79?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=Kwpbvma/25e24292ffd49924981d4897dca2fb79&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed Kwpbvma/25e24292ffd49924981d4897dca2fb79\" title=\"CodePen Embed Kwpbvma/25e24292ffd49924981d4897dca2fb79\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t forget about this trick. It can help you optimize a lot of shapes by writing less code.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-move-command\">The <code>move</code> command</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s turn our attention to another <code>shape()</code> command you may rarely use, but can be incredibly useful in certain situations: the <code>move</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Most times when we need to draw a shape, it’s actually <em>one continuous shape</em>. But it may happen that our shape is composed of different parts not linked together. In these situations, the <code>move</code> command is what you will need.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s take an example, similar to the previous one, but this time the triangles don’t touch each other:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvgYeb/6eb4d145ead0b3c000ff1bb8b903ed4c\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvgYeb/6eb4d145ead0b3c000ff1bb8b903ed4c?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvgYeb/6eb4d145ead0b3c000ff1bb8b903ed4c&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvgYeb/6eb4d145ead0b3c000ff1bb8b903ed4c\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvgYeb/6eb4d145ead0b3c000ff1bb8b903ed4c\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Intuitively, we may think we need four separate elements, with its own <code>shape()</code> definition. But the that example is a single shape!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The trick is to draw the first triangle, then “move” somewhere else to draw the next one, and so on. The <code>move</code> command is similar to the <code>from</code> command but we use it in the middle of <code>shape()</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(\r\n  from    50% 40%, line to 20%  0,   hline by 60%, close, /* triangle 1 */\r\n  move to 60% 50%, line to 100% 20%, vline by 60%, close, /* triangle 2 */\r\n  move to 50% 60%, line to 20% 100%, hline by 60%, close, /* triangle 3 */\r\n  move to 40% 50%, line to 0   20%,  vline by 60% /* triangle 4 */\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>After drawing the first triangle, we “close” it and “move” to a new point to draw the next triangle. We can have multiple shapes using a single <code>shape()</code> definition. A more generic code will look like the below:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(\r\n  from    X1 Y1, ..., close, /* shape 1 */\r\n  move to X2 Y2, ..., close, /* shape 2 */\r\n  ...\r\n  move to Xn Yn, ... /* shape N */\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>close</code> commands before the <code>move</code> commands aren’t mandatory, so the code can be simplified to this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(\r\n  from    X1 Y1, ..., /* shape 1 */\r\n  move to X2 Y2, ..., /* shape 2 */\r\n  ...\r\n  move to Xn Yn, ... /* shape N */\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvYPBL/fad2cc952270358a11425d6f3cded1e2\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvYPBL/fad2cc952270358a11425d6f3cded1e2?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvYPBL/fad2cc952270358a11425d6f3cded1e2&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvYPBL/fad2cc952270358a11425d6f3cded1e2\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvYPBL/fad2cc952270358a11425d6f3cded1e2\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s look at a few interesting use cases where this technique can be helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cut-out-shapes\">Cut-out shapes</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, I shared a trick on <a href=\"https://css-tip.com/cut-out-shapes/\" rel=\"noopener\">how to create cut-out shapes</a> using <code>clip-path: polygon()</code>. Starting from any kind of polygon, we can easily invert it to get its cut-out version:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gOJvdav\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/gOJvdav?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=gOJvdav&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gOJvdav\" title=\"CodePen Embed gOJvdav\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can do the same using <code>shape()</code>. The idea is to have an intersection between the main shape and the rectangle shape that fits the element boundaries. We need two shapes, hence the need for the <code>move</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The code is as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.shape {\r\n  clip-path: shape(from ...., move to 0 0, hline to 100%, vline to 100%, hline to 0);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You start by creating your main shape and then you “move” to <code>0 0</code> and you create the rectangle shape (Remember, It’s the first shape we create in <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/#aa-rectangle\">the first part of this series</a>). We can even go further and introduce a CSS variable to easily switch between the normal shape and the inverted one.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.shape {\r\n  clip-path: shape(from .... var(--i,));\r\n}\r\n.invert {\r\n  --i:,move to 0 0, hline to 100%, vline to 100%, hline to 0;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>By default, <code>--i</code> is not defined so <code>var(--i,)</code>will be empty and we get the main shape. If we define the variable with the rectangle shape, we get the inverted version.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here is an example using a rounded hexagon shape:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvYWNr/2586e5e748c02e41dec139ccdbc22971\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvYWNr/2586e5e748c02e41dec139ccdbc22971?height=700&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvYWNr/2586e5e748c02e41dec139ccdbc22971&default-tab=result\" height=\"700\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvYWNr/2586e5e748c02e41dec139ccdbc22971\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvYWNr/2586e5e748c02e41dec139ccdbc22971\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, the code should be as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.shape {\r\n  clip-path: shape(evenodd from .... var(--i,));\r\n}\r\n.invert {\r\n  --i:,move to 0 0, hline to 100%, vline to 100%, hline to 0;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Notice the <code>evenodd</code> I am adding at the beginning of <code>shape()</code>. I won’t bother you with a detailed explanation on what it does but in some cases, the inverted shape is not visible and the fix is to add <code>evenodd</code> at the beginning. You can check <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/fill-rule\" rel=\"noopener\">the MDN page for more details</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another improvement we can do is to add a variable to control the space around the shape. Let’s suppose you want to make the hexagon shape of the previous example smaller. It‘s tedious to update the code of the hexagon but it’s easier to update the code of the rectangle shape.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.shape {\r\n  clip-path: shape(evenodd from ... var(--i,)) content-box;\r\n}\r\n.invert {\r\n  --d: 20px;\r\n  padding: var(--d);\r\n  --i: ,move to calc(-1*var(--d)) calc(-1*var(--d)),\r\n        hline to calc(100% + var(--d)),\r\n        vline to calc(100% + var(--d)),\r\n        hline to calc(-1*var(--d));\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We first update the reference box of the shape to be <code>content-box</code>. Then we add some padding which will logically reduce the area of the shape since it will no longer include the padding (nor the border). The padding is excluded (invisible) by default and here comes the trick where we update the rectangle shape to re-include the padding.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That is why the <code>--i</code> variable is so verbose. It uses the value of the padding to extend the rectangle area and cover the whole element as if we didn’t have <code>content-box</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvYWRG/b409a57e82d07eb39c5e9d667b7a708c\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvYWRG/b409a57e82d07eb39c5e9d667b7a708c?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvYWRG/b409a57e82d07eb39c5e9d667b7a708c&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvYWRG/b409a57e82d07eb39c5e9d667b7a708c\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvYWRG/b409a57e82d07eb39c5e9d667b7a708c\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Not only you can easily invert any kind of shape, but you can also control the space around it! Here is another demo using the CSS-Tricks logo to illustrate how easy the method is:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_PwqxMaN/6e8c6ea82dd95d7282fadb85894e245c\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/PwqxMaN/6e8c6ea82dd95d7282fadb85894e245c?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=PwqxMaN/6e8c6ea82dd95d7282fadb85894e245c&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed PwqxMaN/6e8c6ea82dd95d7282fadb85894e245c\" title=\"CodePen Embed PwqxMaN/6e8c6ea82dd95d7282fadb85894e245c\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This exact same example is available in my <a href=\"https://css-generators.com/svg-to-css/\" rel=\"noopener\">SVG-to-CSS converter</a>, providing you with the <code>shape()</code> code without having to do all of the math.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"repetitive-shapes\">Repetitive shapes</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another interesting use case of the <code>move</code> command is when we need to repeat the same shape multiple times. Do you remember the difference between the <code>by</code> and the <code>to</code> directives? The <code>by</code> directive allows us to define relative coordinates considering the previous point. So, if we create our shape using only <code>by</code>, we can easily reuse the same code as many times as we want.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s start with a simple example of a circle shape:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(from X Y, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Starting from <code>X Y</code>, I draw a first arc moving upward by <code>50px</code>, then I get back to <code>X Y</code> with another arc using the same offset, but downward. If you are a bit lost with the syntax, try reviewing <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">Part 1</a> to refresh your memory about the <code>arc</code> command.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>How I drew the shape is not important. What is important is that whatever the value of <code>X Y</code> is, I will always get the same circle but in a different position. Do you see where I am going with this idea? If I want to add another circle, I simply repeat the same code with a different <code>X Y</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: shape(\r\n  from    X1 Y1, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%,\r\n  move to X2 Y2, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And since the code is the same, I can store the circle shape into a CSS variable and draw as many circles as I want:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.shape {\r\n  --sh:, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%;\r\n  \r\n  clip-path: shape(\r\n    from    X1 Y1 var(--sh),\r\n    move to X2 Y2 var(--sh),\r\n    ... \r\n    move to Xn Yn var(--sh)\r\n  ) \r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You don’t want a circle? Easy, you can update the <code>--sh</code> variable with any shape you want. Here is an example with three different shapes:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_MYwZgEL/97583111b04d9aeb8d850ea02ea49289\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/MYwZgEL/97583111b04d9aeb8d850ea02ea49289?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=MYwZgEL/97583111b04d9aeb8d850ea02ea49289&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed MYwZgEL/97583111b04d9aeb8d850ea02ea49289\" title=\"CodePen Embed MYwZgEL/97583111b04d9aeb8d850ea02ea49289\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And guess what? You can invert the whole thing using the cut-out technique by adding the rectangle shape at the end:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_ByNEgVw/94fc702f01d47459f7a89a22644cf27d\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/ByNEgVw/94fc702f01d47459f7a89a22644cf27d?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=ByNEgVw/94fc702f01d47459f7a89a22644cf27d&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed ByNEgVw/94fc702f01d47459f7a89a22644cf27d\" title=\"CodePen Embed ByNEgVw/94fc702f01d47459f7a89a22644cf27d\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This code is a perfect example of the <code>shape()</code> function’s power. We don’t have any code duplication and we can simply adjust the shape with CSS variables. This is something we are unable to achieve with the <code>path()</code> function because it doesn’t support variables.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s all for this fourth installment of our series on the CSS <code>shape()</code> function! We didn’t make any super complex shapes, but we learned how two simple commands can open a lot of possibilities of what can be done using <code>shape()</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Just for fun, here is one more demo recreating a classic <a href=\"https://css-tip.com/dots-loader/\" rel=\"noopener\">three-dot loader</a> using the last technique we covered.

JavaScript에 새로운 불변(immutable) 원시 타입인 <code>Record</code>와 <code>Tuple</code>을 도입하여, 구조적 동등성 비교와 깊은 불변성을 지원하려는 시도였습니다. 이러한 기능은 상태 관리와 같은 복잡한 애플리케이션에서 유용할 것으로 기대되었습니다.</p><p>그러나 이 제안은 새로운 원시 타입의 도입으로 인한 엔진 복잡성 증가, 깊은 비교의 성능 문제, 기존 동등성 비교 규칙과의 불일치 등의 이유로 TC39 위원회에서 충분한 합의를 얻지 못하고 철회되었습니다.</p><p>이 글은 자바스크립트의 최신 제안과 TC39의 동향에 관심 있는 개발자, 불변성과 구조적 동등성 비교에 대한 이해를 높이고자 하는 프론트엔드 개발자, 상태 관리와 성능 최적화에 관심 있는 개발자, ECMAScript의 표준화 과정과 제안 철회의 배경을 이해하고자 하는 분들에게 추천드립니다!</p><h2>목차</h2><ul><li><p>레코드와 튜플의 제안은 어떤 내용이었나요?</p></li><li><p>철회 사유</p></li><li><p>새로운 원시 타입(primitive type) 추가</p></li><li><p>깊은

코드를 직접 작성하던 시대에서 AI와 함께 문제 해결에 집중하는 방향으로 바뀌고 있으며, 이로 인한 소프트웨어 산업 전반의 변화를 심도 있게 분석한다.</p><p>소프트웨어가 다시 한번 근본적으로 변화하고 있으며, 이는 업계에 진출하기에 매우 특별하고 흥미로운 시기임을 의미한다. 지난 70년간 소프트웨어는 몇 차례의 큰 변화를 겪었으며, 현재 우리는 또 다른 변혁의 시대를 맞이하고 있다.</p><p>소프트웨어는 크게 세 가지 패러다임으로 나눌 수 있으며 1.0은 컴퓨터를 위해 작성하는 코드, 2.0은 신경망의 가중치, 그리고 3.0은 LLM을 프로그래밍하는 프롬프트로 정의할 수 있다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.haydenbleasel.com/blog/on-javascript-errors\">On JavaScript Errors</a></h2><p>JavaScript에서 오류 처리는 매우 중요한 개발 기술이지만, 종종 코드 작성 시 간과되 한다. 이 글에서 저자는 JavaScript의 내장 <code>Error</code> 객체와 다양한 오류 타입(<code>SyntaxError</code>, <code>TypeError</code>, <code>RangeError</code> 등)의 효과적인 활용법을 설명한다. 특히 커스텀 에러 클래스를 생성하여 사용자 정의 오류 처리의 중요성을 강조하며, 이를 통해 더 구체적이고 의미 있는 오류 메시지를 제공할 수 있음을 보여준다.</p><p>또한 try-catch 구문을 사용한 오류 핸들링과 함께, 비동기 코드에서의 오류 처리 방법, 그리고 TypeScript를 활용한 타입 안전성 개선에 대해서도 다루고 있다. 좋은 오류 처리는 단순히 코드 실패를 방지하는 것을 넘어, 디버깅 시간을 줄이고 코드 품질을 향상시키는 필수적인 요소라는 점을 강조한다.</p><h2><a

    "title": "The Gap Strikes Back: Now Stylable",
    "content": "<p>Four years ago, I wrote an article titled <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/minding-the-gap/\">Minding the “gap”</a>, where I talked about the CSS <code>gap</code> property, where it applied, and how it worked with various CSS layouts.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, I described how easy it was to evenly space items out in a flex, grid, or multi-column layout, by using the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/g/gap/\">gap</a></code> property. But, I also said that <em>styling</em> the gap areas was much harder, and I shared a workaround.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, workarounds like using extra HTML elements, pseudo-elements, or borders to draw separator lines tend to come with drawbacks, especially those that impact your layout size, interfere with assistive technologies, or pollute your markup with style-only elements.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Today, I’m writing again about layout gaps, but this time, to tell you all about a new and exciting CSS feature that’s going to change it all. <strong>What you previously had to use workarounds for, you’ll soon be able to do with just a few simple CSS properties that make it easy, yet also flexible, to display styled separators between your layout items.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There’s already a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gaps-1/\" rel=\"noopener\">specification draft for the feature</a> you can peruse. At the time I’m writing this, it is available in Chrome and Edge 139 behind a flag. But I believe it won’t be long before we turn that flag on. I believe other browsers are also very receptive and engaged.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Displaying decorative lines between items of a layout can make a big difference. When used well, these lines can bring more structure to your layout, and give your users more of a sense of how the different regions of a page are organized.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387471\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"introducing-css-gap-decorations\">Introducing CSS gap decorations</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you’ve ever used a multi-column layout, such as by using the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/column-width/\">column-width</a></code> property, then you might already be familiar with gap decorations.

The key benefit here is that the decoration happens in CSS only, where it belongs, with no impacts to your semantic markup.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The CSS gap decorations feature also introduces a new <code>row-rule</code> property for drawing lines between rows:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.my-flex-container {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  gap: 10px;\r\n  row-rule: 10px dotted limegreen;\r\n  column-rule: 5px dashed coral;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1375\" height=\"205\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=1375%2C205&ssl=1\" alt=\"Six items flowing horizontally in two rows in a flex container, separated by 5-pixel dashed coral-colored vertical lines and a single 10-pixel dotted lime-green line between the two rows.\" class=\"wp-image-387559\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?w=1375&ssl=1 1375w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=300%2C45&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=1024%2C153&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=768%2C115&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But that’s not all, because the above syntax also allows you to define multiple, comma-separated, line style values, and use the same <code>repeat()</code> function that CSS grid already uses for row and column templates. This makes it possible to define different styles of line decorations in a single layout, and adapt to an unknown number of gaps:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.my-container {\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  gap: 2px;\r\n  row-rule:\r\n    repeat(2, 1px dashed red),\r\n    2px solid black,\r\n    repeat(auto, 1px dotted green);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1429\" height=\"741\" src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-4.svg\" alt=\"Seven text blocks stacked vertically separated by horizontal lines that are styled differently.\" class=\"wp-image-387560\"/></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the CSS gap decorations feature comes with additional CSS properties such as <code>row-rule-break</code>, <code>column-rule-break</code>, <code>row-rule-outset</code>, <code>column-rule-outset</code>, and <code>gap-rule-paint-order</code>, which make it possible to precisely customize the way the separators are drawn, whether they overlap, or where they start and end.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And of course, all of this works across <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/\">grid</a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\">flexbox</a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/revisiting-css-multi-column-layout/\">multi-column</a>, and soon, <a href=\"https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2025/05/21/masonry-item-flow-and-gulp/\" rel=\"noopener\">masonry</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"browser-support\">Browser support</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the CSS gap decorations feature is only available in Chromium-based browsers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The feature is still early in the making, and there’s time for you all to try it and to provide feedback that could help make the feature better and more adapted to your needs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to try the feature today, make sure to use Edge or Chrome, starting with version 139 (or another Chromium-based browser that matches those versions), and enable the flag by following these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>In Chrome or Edge, go to <code>about://flags</code>.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>In the search field, search for <strong>Enable Experimental Web Platform Features</strong>.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Enable the flag.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Restart the browser.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To put this all into practice, let’s walk through an example together that uses the new CSS gap decorations feature. <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/css-gap-decorations/personal-site.html\" rel=\"noopener\">I also have a final example you can demo.</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"using-css-gap-decorations\">Using CSS gap decorations</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s build a simple web page to learn how to use the feature.

This way, we can space out the <code><header></code>, <code><nav></code>, <code><main></code>, and <code><footer></code> elements apart in one go by using the <code>gap</code> property:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  gap: 4rem;\r\n  margin: 2rem;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s now use the CSS gap decorations feature to display horizontal separator lines within the gaps we just defined:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  gap: 4rem;\r\n  margin: 2rem;\r\n \r\n  row-rule: 1rem solid #efefef;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This gives us the following result:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1451\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-02.svg\" alt=\"The basic layout for the webpage.

There are no lines between items in the layout.\" class=\"wp-image-387487\"/></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can do a bit better by making the first horizontal line look different than the other two lines, and simplify the <code>row-rule</code> value by using the <code>repeat()</code> syntax:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  gap: 4rem;\r\n  margin: 2rem;\r\n \r\n  row-rule:\r\n    1rem solid #efefef,\r\n    repeat(2, 2px solid #efefef);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With this new <code>row-rule</code> property value, we’re telling the browser to draw the first horizontal separator as a <code>1rem</code> thick line, and the next two separators as <code>2px</code> thick lines, which gives the following result:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1452\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-03.svg\" alt=\"The webpage is largely the same, but the border between the site title and the navigation is much thicker.\" class=\"wp-image-387488\"/></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let’s turn our attention to the navigation element and its list of links. We’ll use flexbox to display the links in a single row, where each link is separated from the other links by a gap and a vertical line:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">nav ul {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n  gap: 2rem;\r\n  column-rule: 2px dashed #666;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Very similarly to how we used the <code>row-rule</code> property before, we’re now using the <code>column-rule</code> property to display a dashed <code>2px</code> thick separator between the links.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Our example web page now looks like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1552\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=1552%2C1600&ssl=1\" alt=\"The webpage is still largely the same, but now the navigation is horizontal and there is a light dashed line between the links.\" class=\"wp-image-387482\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?w=1552&ssl=1 1552w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=291%2C300&ssl=1 291w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=993%2C1024&ssl=1 993w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=768%2C792&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=1490%2C1536&ssl=1 1490w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The last thing we need to change is the <code><main></code> element and its paragraphs and pictures.

We’re also making the items have a flex basis size of <code>200px</code> for pictures and <code>400px</code> for text, and allowing them to grow and shrink as needed. This gives us the following result:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1494\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-05.svg\" alt=\"The webpage layout has been established but there are no lines between items.\" class=\"wp-image-387489\"/></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s use CSS gap decorations to bring a little more structure to our layout by drawing <code>2px</code> thick separator lines between the rows and columns of the layout:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">main {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n  gap: 4rem;\r\n  row-rule: 2px solid #999;\r\n  column-rule: 2px solid #999;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This gives us the following result, which is very close to our expected design:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-06.webp?resize=1500%2C1600&ssl=1\" alt=\"Thin light lines have been added between the layout of text and images, creating a masonry-like layout.

    "title": "The Gap Strikes Back: Now Stylable",
    "content": "<p>Four years ago, I wrote an article titled <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/minding-the-gap/\">Minding the “gap”</a>, where I talked about the CSS <code>gap</code> property, where it applied, and how it worked with various CSS layouts.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>At the time, I described how easy it was to evenly space items out in a flex, grid, or multi-column layout, by using the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/g/gap/\">gap</a></code> property. But, I also said that <em>styling</em> the gap areas was much harder, and I shared a workaround.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, workarounds like using extra HTML elements, pseudo-elements, or borders to draw separator lines tend to come with drawbacks, especially those that impact your layout size, interfere with assistive technologies, or pollute your markup with style-only elements.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Today, I’m writing again about layout gaps, but this time, to tell you all about a new and exciting CSS feature that’s going to change it all. <strong>What you previously had to use workarounds for, you’ll soon be able to do with just a few simple CSS properties that make it easy, yet also flexible, to display styled separators between your layout items.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There’s already a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gaps-1/\" rel=\"noopener\">specification draft for the feature</a> you can peruse. At the time I’m writing this, it is available in Chrome and Edge 139 behind a flag. But I believe it won’t be long before we turn that flag on. I believe other browsers are also very receptive and engaged.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Displaying decorative lines between items of a layout can make a big difference. When used well, these lines can bring more structure to your layout, and give your users more of a sense of how the different regions of a page are organized.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387471\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"introducing-css-gap-decorations\">Introducing CSS gap decorations</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you’ve ever used a multi-column layout, such as by using the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/column-width/\">column-width</a></code> property, then you might already be familiar with gap decorations. You can draw vertical lines between the columns of a multi-column layout by using the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/column-rule/\">column-rule</a></code> property:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">article {\r\n  column-width: 20rem;\r\n  column-rule: 1px solid black;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1254\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-1.webp?resize=1254%2C383&ssl=1\" alt=\"Two 1-pixel solid black vertical lines separate a row of three text blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-387557\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-1.webp?w=1254&ssl=1 1254w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-1.webp?resize=300%2C92&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-1.webp?resize=1024%2C313&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-1.webp?resize=768%2C235&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The CSS gap decorations feature builds on this to provide a more comprehensive system that makes it easy for you to draw separator lines in other layout types.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the draft specification says that the <code>column-rule</code> property also works in flexbox and grid layouts:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.my-grid-container {\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  gap: 2px;\r\n  column-rule: 2px solid pink;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1217\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-2.webp?resize=1217%2C436&ssl=1\" alt=\"A 2-pixel solid light pink vertical line separates two side-by-side text blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-387558\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-2.webp?w=1217&ssl=1 1217w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-2.webp?resize=300%2C107&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-2.webp?resize=1024%2C367&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-2.webp?resize=768%2C275&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>No need for extra elements or borders! The key benefit here is that the decoration happens in CSS only, where it belongs, with no impacts to your semantic markup.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The CSS gap decorations feature also introduces a new <code>row-rule</code> property for drawing lines between rows:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.my-flex-container {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  gap: 10px;\r\n  row-rule: 10px dotted limegreen;\r\n  column-rule: 5px dashed coral;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1375\" height=\"205\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=1375%2C205&ssl=1\" alt=\"Six items flowing horizontally in two rows in a flex container, separated by 5-pixel dashed coral-colored vertical lines and a single 10-pixel dotted lime-green line between the two rows.\" class=\"wp-image-387559\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?w=1375&ssl=1 1375w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=300%2C45&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=1024%2C153&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=768%2C115&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But that’s not all, because the above syntax also allows you to define multiple, comma-separated, line style values, and use the same <code>repeat()</code> function that CSS grid already uses for row and column templates. This makes it possible to define different styles of line decorations in a single layout, and adapt to an unknown number of gaps:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.my-container {\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  gap: 2px;\r\n  row-rule:\r\n    repeat(2, 1px dashed red),\r\n    2px solid black,\r\n    repeat(auto, 1px dotted green);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1429\" height=\"741\" src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-4.svg\" alt=\"Seven text blocks stacked vertically separated by horizontal lines that are styled differently.\" class=\"wp-image-387560\"/></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the CSS gap decorations feature comes with additional CSS properties such as <code>row-rule-break</code>, <code>column-rule-break</code>, <code>row-rule-outset</code>, <code>column-rule-outset</code>, and <code>gap-rule-paint-order</code>, which make it possible to precisely customize the way the separators are drawn, whether they overlap, or where they start and end.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And of course, all of this works across <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/\">grid</a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\">flexbox</a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/revisiting-css-multi-column-layout/\">multi-column</a>, and soon, <a href=\"https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2025/05/21/masonry-item-flow-and-gulp/\" rel=\"noopener\">masonry</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"browser-support\">Browser support</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the CSS gap decorations feature is only available in Chromium-based browsers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The feature is still early in the making, and there’s time for you all to try it and to provide feedback that could help make the feature better and more adapted to your needs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to try the feature today, make sure to use Edge or Chrome, starting with version 139 (or another Chromium-based browser that matches those versions), and enable the flag by following these steps:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>In Chrome or Edge, go to <code>about://flags</code>.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>In the search field, search for <strong>Enable Experimental Web Platform Features</strong>.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Enable the flag.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Restart the browser.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To put this all into practice, let’s walk through an example together that uses the new CSS gap decorations feature. <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/css-gap-decorations/personal-site.html\" rel=\"noopener\">I also have a final example you can demo.</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"using-css-gap-decorations\">Using CSS gap decorations</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s build a simple web page to learn how to use the feature. Here is what we’ll be building:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1501\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-01.svg\" alt=\"Webpage titled My Personal Site in the header above a horizontal navigation and a staggered, masonry-like layout of text and images with thin lines between them. The design is in black and white.\" class=\"wp-image-387486\"/></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The above layout contains a header section with a title, a navigation menu with a few links, a main section with a series of short paragraphs of text and photos, and a footer.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll use the following markup:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><body>\r\n<header>\r\n  <h1>My personal site</h1>\r\n</header>\r\n<nav>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Home</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Blog</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#\">About</a></li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#\">Links</a></li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</nav>\r\n<main>\r\n  <article>\r\n    <p>...</p>\r\n  </article>\r\n  <article>\r\n    <img src=\"cat.jpg\" alt=\"A sleeping cat.\">\r\n  </article>\r\n  <article>\r\n    <p>...</p>\r\n  </article>\r\n  <article>\r\n    <img src=\"tree.jpg\" alt=\"An old olive tree trunk.\">\r\n  </article>\r\n  <article>\r\n    <p>...</p>\r\n  </article>\r\n  <article>\r\n    <p>...</p>\r\n  </article>\r\n  <article>\r\n    <p>...</p>\r\n  </article>\r\n  <article>\r\n    <img src=\"strings.jpg\" alt=\"Snow flakes falling in a motion blur effect.\">\r\n  </article>\r\n</main>\r\n<footer>\r\n  <p>© 2025 Patrick Brosset</p>\r\n</footer>\r\n</body></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll start by making the <code><body></code> element be a grid container. This way, we can space out the <code><header></code>, <code><nav></code>, <code><main></code>, and <code><footer></code> elements apart in one go by using the <code>gap</code> property:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  gap: 4rem;\r\n  margin: 2rem;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s now use the CSS gap decorations feature to display horizontal separator lines within the gaps we just defined:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  gap: 4rem;\r\n  margin: 2rem;\r\n \r\n  row-rule: 1rem solid #efefef;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This gives us the following result:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1451\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-02.svg\" alt=\"The basic layout for the webpage. The title is the same but the navigation and layout are both vertically stacked. There are no lines between items in the layout.\" class=\"wp-image-387487\"/></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can do a bit better by making the first horizontal line look different than the other two lines, and simplify the <code>row-rule</code> value by using the <code>repeat()</code> syntax:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\r\n  display: grid;\r\n  gap: 4rem;\r\n  margin: 2rem;\r\n \r\n  row-rule:\r\n    1rem solid #efefef,\r\n    repeat(2, 2px solid #efefef);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With this new <code>row-rule</code> property value, we’re telling the browser to draw the first horizontal separator as a <code>1rem</code> thick line, and the next two separators as <code>2px</code> thick lines, which gives the following result:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1452\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-03.svg\" alt=\"The webpage is largely the same, but the border between the site title and the navigation is much thicker.\" class=\"wp-image-387488\"/></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let’s turn our attention to the navigation element and its list of links. We’ll use flexbox to display the links in a single row, where each link is separated from the other links by a gap and a vertical line:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">nav ul {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n  gap: 2rem;\r\n  column-rule: 2px dashed #666;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Very similarly to how we used the <code>row-rule</code> property before, we’re now using the <code>column-rule</code> property to display a dashed <code>2px</code> thick separator between the links.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Our example web page now looks like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1552\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=1552%2C1600&ssl=1\" alt=\"The webpage is still largely the same, but now the navigation is horizontal and there is a light dashed line between the links.\" class=\"wp-image-387482\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?w=1552&ssl=1 1552w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=291%2C300&ssl=1 291w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=993%2C1024&ssl=1 993w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=768%2C792&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=1490%2C1536&ssl=1 1490w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The last thing we need to change is the <code><main></code> element and its paragraphs and pictures. We’ll use flexbox again and display the various children in a wrapping row of varying width items:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">main {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n  gap: 4rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nmain > * {\r\n  flex: 1 1 200px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nmain article:has(p) {\r\n  flex-basis: 400px;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In the above code snippet, we’re setting the <code><main></code> element to be a wrapping flex container with a <code>4rem</code> gap between items and flex lines. We’re also making the items have a flex basis size of <code>200px</code> for pictures and <code>400px</code> for text, and allowing them to grow and shrink as needed. This gives us the following result:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1494\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-05.svg\" alt=\"The webpage layout has been established but there are no lines between items.\" class=\"wp-image-387489\"/></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s use CSS gap decorations to bring a little more structure to our layout by drawing <code>2px</code> thick separator lines between the rows and columns of the layout:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">main {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n  gap: 4rem;\r\n  row-rule: 2px solid #999;\r\n  column-rule: 2px solid #999;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This gives us the following result, which is very close to our expected design:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-06.webp?resize=1500%2C1600&ssl=1\" alt=\"Thin light lines have been added between the layout of text and images, creating a masonry-like layout.

나타낸다고 설명합니다. 이러한 관점에서 선언형 프로그래밍과 명령형 프로그래밍의 차이를 명확히 구분하며, React Server Component가 이 두 패러다임을 어떻게 조화시키는지 보여줍니다.</p><p>특히 \"Early World\"와 \"Late World\"라는 개념을 통해 서버와 클라이언트에서 실행되는 코드의 역할을 구분하고, 각각의 실행

    "title": "Using CSS Cascade Layers With Tailwind Utilities",
    "content": "<p>Adam Wathan has (very cleverly) built Tailwind with <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/\">CSS Cascade Layers</a>, making it extremely powerful for organizing styles by priority.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@layer theme, base, components, utilities;\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/theme.css' layer(theme);\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities.css' layer(utilities);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The core of Tailwind are its utilities. This means you have two choices:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>The default choice</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The unorthodox choice</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-386907\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-default-choice\">The default choice</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The default choice is to follow Tailwind’s recommended layer order: place components first, and Tailwind utilities last.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, if you’re building components, you need to manually wrap your components with a <code>@layer</code> directive. Then, overwrite your component styles with Tailwind, putting Tailwind as the “most important layer”.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Write your components */\r\n@layer components {\r\n  .component {\r\n    /* Your CSS here */\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><!-- Override with Tailwind utilities --> \r\n<div class=\"component p-4\"> ... </div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s a decent way of doing things.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But, being the bad boy I am, I don’t take the default approach as the “best” one. Over a year of (major) experimentation with Tailwind and vanilla CSS, I’ve come across what I believe is a better solution.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-unorthodox-choice\">The Unorthodox Choice</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before we go on, I have to tell you that I’m writing a course called <a href=\"https://magicaldevschool.com/courses/unorthodox-tailwind/\" rel=\"noopener\">Unorthodox Tailwind</a> — this shows you everything I know about using Tailwind and CSS in synergistic ways, leveraging the strengths of each.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Shameless plug aside, let’s dive into the Unorthodox Choice now.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the Unorthodox Choice is to write your styles in an unnamed layer — or any layer after utilities, really — so that your CSS naturally overwrites Tailwind utilities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Of these two, I prefer the unnamed layer option:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Unnamed layer option */\r\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities; \r\n\r\n/* Write your CSS normally here */ \r\n.component { /* ... */ }</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Named layer option */\r\n/* Use whatever layer name you come up with. I simply used css here because it made most sense for explaining things */\r\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities, css; \r\n\r\n@layer css {\r\n  .component { /* ... */ }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I have many reasons why I do this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>I don’t like to add unnecessary CSS layers because it makes code harder to write — more keystrokes, having to remember the specific layer I used it in, etc.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>I’m pretty skilled with <a href=\"https://itcss.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ITCSS</a>, selector specificity, and all the good-old-stuff you’d expect from a seasoned front-end developer, so writing CSS in a single layer doesn’t scare me at all.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>I can do complex stuff that are hard or impossible to do in Tailwind (like theming and animations) in CSS.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Your mileage may vary, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you have followed my reasoning so far, you would have noticed that I use Tailwind <em>very</em> differently:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Tailwind utilities are not the “most important” layer.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>My unnamed CSS layer is the most important one.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I do this so I can:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Build prototypes with Tailwind</strong> (quickly, easily, especially with the <a href=\"https://splendidlabz/docs/layouts/\">tools</a> I’ve created).</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Shift these properties to CSS</strong> when they get more complex — so I don’t have to read messy utility-littered HTML that makes my heart sink. Not because utility HTML is bad, but because it takes lots of brain processing power to figure out what’s happening.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, here’s the nice thing about Tailwind being in a utility layer: I can always <code>!important</code> a utility to give it strength.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><!-- !important the padding utility -->\r\n<div class=\"component !p-4\"> ... </div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Whoa, hold on, wait a minute! Isn’t this wrong, you might ask?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nope. The <code>!important</code> keyword has traditionally been used to override classes. In this case, we’re leveraging on the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/#important-origins-context-and-layers-are-reversed\"><code>!important</code> feature in CSS Layers</a> to say the Tailwind utility is more important than any CSS in the unnamed layer.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is perfectly valid and is a built-in feature for CSS Layers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, the <code>!important</code> is so explicit (and used so little) that it makes sense for one-off quick-and-dirty adjustments (without creating a brand new selector for it).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tailwind-utilities-are-more-powerful-than-they-seem\">Tailwind utilities are more powerful than they seem</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tailwind utilities are not a 1:1 map between a class and a CSS property. Built-in Tailwind utilities mostly look like this so it can give people a wrong impression.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tailwind utilities are more like <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/tailwinds-apply-feature-is-better-than-it-sounds/\">convenient Sass mixins</a>, which means we can build effective tools for <a href=\"https://splendidlabz/docs/layouts/\">layouts</a>, theming, typography, and more, through them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can find out about these thoughts inside <a href=\"https://magicaldevschool.com/courses/unorthodox-tailwind/\" rel=\"noopener\">Unorthodox Tailwind</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you’re enjoying a new way of looking at (or using) Tailwind!</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/using-css-cascade-layers-with-tailwind-utilities/\">Using CSS Cascade Layers With Tailwind Utilities</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=css-tricks.com&utm_campaign=family_&utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

    "content": "<p>Adam Wathan has (very cleverly) built Tailwind with <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/\">CSS Cascade Layers</a>, making it extremely powerful for organizing styles by priority.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@layer theme, base, components, utilities;\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/theme.css' layer(theme);\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities.css' layer(utilities);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The core of Tailwind are its utilities. This means you have two choices:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>The default choice</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The unorthodox choice</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-386907\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-default-choice\">The default choice</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The default choice is to follow Tailwind’s recommended layer order: place components first, and Tailwind utilities last.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, if you’re building components, you need to manually wrap your components with a <code>@layer</code> directive. Then, overwrite your component styles with Tailwind, putting Tailwind as the “most important layer”.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Write your components */\r\n@layer components {\r\n  .component {\r\n    /* Your CSS here */\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><!-- Override with Tailwind utilities --> \r\n<div class=\"component p-4\"> ... </div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s a decent way of doing things.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But, being the bad boy I am, I don’t take the default approach as the “best” one. Over a year of (major) experimentation with Tailwind and vanilla CSS, I’ve come across what I believe is a better solution.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-unorthodox-choice\">The Unorthodox Choice</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Before we go on, I have to tell you that I’m writing a course called <a href=\"https://magicaldevschool.com/courses/unorthodox-tailwind/\" rel=\"noopener\">Unorthodox Tailwind</a> — this shows you everything I know about using Tailwind and CSS in synergistic ways, leveraging the strengths of each.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Shameless plug aside, let’s dive into the Unorthodox Choice now.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the Unorthodox Choice is to write your styles in an unnamed layer — or any layer after utilities, really — so that your CSS naturally overwrites Tailwind utilities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Of these two, I prefer the unnamed layer option:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Unnamed layer option */\r\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities; \r\n\r\n/* Write your CSS normally here */ \r\n.component { /* ... */ }</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Named layer option */\r\n/* Use whatever layer name you come up with. I simply used css here because it made most sense for explaining things */\r\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities, css; \r\n\r\n@layer css {\r\n  .component { /* ... */ }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I have many reasons why I do this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>I don’t like to add unnecessary CSS layers because it makes code harder to write — more keystrokes, having to remember the specific layer I used it in, etc.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>I’m pretty skilled with <a href=\"https://itcss.io\" rel=\"noopener\">ITCSS</a>, selector specificity, and all the good-old-stuff you’d expect from a seasoned front-end developer, so writing CSS in a single layer doesn’t scare me at all.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>I can do complex stuff that are hard or impossible to do in Tailwind (like theming and animations) in CSS.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Your mileage may vary, of course.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, if you have followed my reasoning so far, you would have noticed that I use Tailwind <em>very</em> differently:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Tailwind utilities are not the “most important” layer.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>My unnamed CSS layer is the most important one.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I do this so I can:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Build prototypes with Tailwind</strong> (quickly, easily, especially with the <a href=\"https://splendidlabz/docs/layouts/\">tools</a> I’ve created).</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Shift these properties to CSS</strong> when they get more complex — so I don’t have to read messy utility-littered HTML that makes my heart sink. Not because utility HTML is bad, but because it takes lots of brain processing power to figure out what’s happening.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, here’s the nice thing about Tailwind being in a utility layer: I can always <code>!important</code> a utility to give it strength.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><!-- !important the padding utility -->\r\n<div class=\"component !p-4\"> ... </div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Whoa, hold on, wait a minute! Isn’t this wrong, you might ask?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Nope. The <code>!important</code> keyword has traditionally been used to override classes. In this case, we’re leveraging on the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/#important-origins-context-and-layers-are-reversed\"><code>!important</code> feature in CSS Layers</a> to say the Tailwind utility is more important than any CSS in the unnamed layer.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is perfectly valid and is a built-in feature for CSS Layers.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Besides, the <code>!important</code> is so explicit (and used so little) that it makes sense for one-off quick-and-dirty adjustments (without creating a brand new selector for it).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tailwind-utilities-are-more-powerful-than-they-seem\">Tailwind utilities are more powerful than they seem</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tailwind utilities are not a 1:1 map between a class and a CSS property. Built-in Tailwind utilities mostly look like this so it can give people a wrong impression.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Tailwind utilities are more like <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/tailwinds-apply-feature-is-better-than-it-sounds/\">convenient Sass mixins</a>, which means we can build effective tools for <a href=\"https://splendidlabz/docs/layouts/\">layouts</a>, theming, typography, and more, through them.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You can find out about these thoughts inside <a href=\"https://magicaldevschool.com/courses/unorthodox-tailwind/\" rel=\"noopener\">Unorthodox Tailwind</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you’re enjoying a new way of looking at (or using) Tailwind!</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/using-css-cascade-layers-with-tailwind-utilities/\">Using CSS Cascade Layers With Tailwind Utilities</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=css-tricks.com&utm_campaign=family_&utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

    "content": "<p><em>Blob, Blob, Blob</em>. You hate them. You love them. Personally, as a design illiterate, I like to overuse them… a lot. And when you repeat the same process over and over again, it’s only a question of how much you can optimize it, or in this case, what’s the easiest way to create blobs in CSS? Turns out, as always, there are many approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387089\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To know if our following blobs are worth using, we’ll need them to pass three tests:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>They can be with just a single element (and preferably without pseudos).</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>They can be easily designed (ideally through an online tool).</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>We can use gradient backgrounds, borders, shadows, and other CSS effects on them.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Without further ado, let’s <em>Blob, Blob, Blob</em> right in.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"just-generate-them-online\">Just generate them online</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I know it’s disenchanting to click on an article about making blobs in CSS just for me to say you can generate them outside CSS. Still, it’s probably the most common way to create blobs on the web, so to be thorough, these are some online tools I’ve used before to create <strong>SVG</strong> blobs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://app.haikei.app/\" rel=\"noopener\">Haikei</a>.</strong> Probably the one I have used the most since, besides blobs, it can also generate lots of SVG backgrounds.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.blobmaker.app/\" rel=\"noopener\">Blobmaker</a>.</strong> A dedicated tool for making blobs. It’s apparently part of Haikei now, so you can use both.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Lastly, almost all graphic programs let you hand-draw blobs and export them as SVGs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For example, this is one I generated just now. Keep it around, as it will come in handy later.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"829\" height=\"766\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=829%2C766&ssl=1\" alt=\"Randomly shaped blob in bright red.\" class=\"wp-image-387090\" style=\"width:407px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?w=829&ssl=1 829w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=300%2C277&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=768%2C710&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><svg viewBox=\"0 0 200 200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\r\n  <path\r\n    fill=\"#FA4D56\"\r\n    d=\"M65.4,-37.9C79.2,-13.9,81,17,68.1,38C55.2,59.1,27.6,70.5,1.5,69.6C-24.6,68.8,-49.3,55.7,-56,38.2C-62.6,20.7,-51.3,-1.2,-39,-24.4C-26.7,-47.6,-13.3,-72,6.2,-75.6C25.8,-79.2,51.6,-62,65.4,-37.9Z\"\r\n    transform=\"translate(100 100)\"\r\n  />\r\n</svg></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"using-border-radius-\">Using <code>border-radius</code></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While counterintuitive, we can use the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border-radius/\">border-radius</a></code> property to create blobs. This technique isn’t new by any means; it was <a href=\"https://9elements.com/blog/css-border-radius-can-do-that/\" rel=\"noopener\">first described by Nils Binder</a> in 2018, but it is still fairly unknown. Even for those who use it, the inner workings are not entirely clear.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To start, you may know the <code>border-radius</code> is a shorthand to each individual corner’s radius, going from the top left corner clockwise. For example, we can set each corner’s <code>border-radius</code> to get a bubbly square shape:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><div class=\"blob\"></div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  border-radius: 25% 50% 75% 100%;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gbpRwZz\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/gbpRwZz?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=gbpRwZz&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gbpRwZz\" title=\"CodePen Embed gbpRwZz\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, what <code>border-radius</code> does — and also why it’s called “radius” — is to shape each corner following a circle of the given radius. For example, if we set the top left corner to <code>25%</code>, it will follow a circle with a radius <code>25%</code> the size of the shape.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  border-top-left-radius: 25%;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_VYLWGve\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/VYLWGve?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=VYLWGve&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed VYLWGve\" title=\"CodePen Embed VYLWGve\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What’s less known is that each corner property is still a <em>shortcut</em> towards its horizontal and vertical radii. Normally, you set both radii to the same value, getting a circle, but you can set them individually to create an ellipse. For example, the following sets the horizontal radius to <code>25%</code> of the element’s width and the vertical to <code>50%</code> of its height:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  border-top-left-radius: 25% 50%;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvOYOo\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvOYOo?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvOYOo&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvOYOo\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvOYOo\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can now shape each corner like an ellipse, and it is the combination of all four ellipses that creates the illusion of a blob! Just take into consideration that to use the horizontal and vertical radii syntax through the <code>border-radius</code> property, we’ll need to separate the horizontal from the vertical radii using a forward slash (<code>/</code>).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  border-radius:\r\n    /* horizontal */\r\n    100% 30% 60% 70% /\r\n    /* vertical */\r\n    50% 40% 70% 70%;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_dPoWMym\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/dPoWMym?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=dPoWMym&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed dPoWMym\" title=\"CodePen Embed dPoWMym\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The syntax isn’t too intuitive, so designing a blob from scratch will likely be a headache.

In the original effect, several elements can be morphed together like drops of liquid sticking to and flowing out of each other:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_LELBEo\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/LELBEo?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=LELBEo&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed LELBEo\" title=\"CodePen Embed LELBEo\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It works by first blurring shapes nearby, creating some connected shadows. Then we crank up the contrast, forcing the blur out and smoothly connecting them in the process. Take, for example, this demo by Chris Coyer (It’s from 2014, so more than 10 years ago!):</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_poXpNL\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/poXpNL?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=poXpNL&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed poXpNL\" title=\"CodePen Embed poXpNL\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you look at the code, you’ll notice Chris uses the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/\"><code>filter</code></a> property along the <code>blur()</code> and <code>contrast()</code> functions, which I’ve also seen in other blob demos. To be specific, it applies <code>blur()</code> on each individual circle and then <code>contrast()</code> on the parent element. So, if we have the following HTML:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><div class=\"blob\">\r\n  <div class=\"subblob\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"subblob\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"subblob\"></div>\r\n</div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>…we would need to apply filters and background colors as such:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  filter: contrast(50);\r\n  background: white; /* Solid colors are necessary */\r\n}\r\n\r\n.subblob {\r\n  filter: blur(15px);\r\n  background: black; /* Solid colors are necessary */\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, there is a good reason why those demos stick to white shapes and black backgrounds (or vice versa) since things get unpredictable once colors aren’t contrast-y enough. See it for yourself in the following demo by changing the color. Just be wary: <em>shades get ugly</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_yyNomvx\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/yyNomvx?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=yyNomvx&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed yyNomvx\" title=\"CodePen Embed yyNomvx\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To solve this, we will use an SVG filter instead. I don’t want to get too technical on SVG (if you want to, read Luca’s post!). In a nutshell, we can apply blurring and contrast filters using SVGs, but now, we can also pick which color channel we apply the contrast to, unlike normal <code>contrast()</code>, which modifies all colors. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since we want to leave color channels (<code>R</code>, <code>G</code> and <code>B</code>) untouched, we will only crank the contrast up for the alpha channel. That translates to the next SVG filter, which can be embedded in the HTML:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.1\" style=\"position: absolute;\">\r\n  <defs>\r\n    <filter id=\"blob\">\r\n      <feGaussianBlur in=\"SourceGraphic\" stdDeviation=\"12\" result=\"blur\" />\r\n      <feColorMatrix in=\"blur\" mode=\"matrix\" values=\"1 0 0 0 0  0 1 0 0 0  0 0 1 0 0  0 0 0 18 -6\" result=\"goo\" />\r\n      <feBlend in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"blob\" />\r\n    </filter>\r\n  </defs>\r\n</svg></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To apply it, we will use again <code>filter</code>, but this time we’ll set it to <code>url(\"#blob\")</code>, so that it pulls the SVG from the HTML.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  filter: url(\"#blob\");\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And now we can even use it with gradient backgrounds!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_MYwvNZL\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/MYwvNZL?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=MYwvNZL&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed MYwvNZL\" title=\"CodePen Embed MYwvNZL\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, this approach comes with two small, but important, changes to common CSS filters:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>The filter is applied to the parent element, not the individual shapes.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The parent element must be transparent (which is a huge advantage). To change the background color, we can instead change the body or other ancestors’ background, and it will work with no issues.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What’s left is to place the <code>.subblob</code> elements together such that they make a blobby enough shape, then apply the SVG filters to morph them:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_bNdrXZv\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/bNdrXZv?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=bNdrXZv&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed bNdrXZv\" title=\"CodePen Embed bNdrXZv\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"making-it-one-element\">Making it one element</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This works well, but it has a similar issue to the blob we made by morphing several <code>border-radius</code> instances: too many elements for a simple blob. Luckily, we can take advantage of the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/\"><code>background</code></a> property to create multiple shapes and morph them together using SVG filters, all in a single element. Since we are keeping it to one element, we will go back to just one empty <code>.blob</code> div:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><div class=\"blob\"></div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To recap, the <code>background</code> shorthand can set all background properties and also set multiple backgrounds at once. Of all the properties, we only care about the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-image/\"><code>background-image</code></a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/\"><code>background-position</code></a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-size/\"><code>background-size</code></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First, we will use <code>background-image</code> along with <code>radial-gradient()</code> to create a circle inside the element:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\r\n  background: radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000);\r\n  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Important! */\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_PwqJYZQ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/PwqJYZQ?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=PwqJYZQ&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed PwqJYZQ\" title=\"CodePen Embed PwqJYZQ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here is what each parameter does:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong><code>farthest-side</code>:</strong> Confines the shape to the element’s box farthest from its center.

Luckily, both can be set on <code>background</code> after the gradient, separated from each other by a forward slash (<code>/</code>).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\r\n  background: radial-gradient(...) 20% 30% / 30% 40%;\r\n  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Important! */\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_PwqJYzR\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/PwqJYzR?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=PwqJYzR&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed PwqJYzR\" title=\"CodePen Embed PwqJYzR\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The first pair of percentages sets the shape’s horizontal and vertical position (taking as a reference the top-left corner), while the second pair sets the shape’s width and height (taking as a reference the element’s size).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As I mentioned, we can stack up different backgrounds together, which means we can create as many circles/ellipses as we want!

We accomplished reducing the blob to a single element, but we still can’t use gradients, borders, or shadows on them, and also, they are tedious to design and model.

More specifically, it uses a verbal version of SVG’s <code>path</code> syntax. The syntax has lots of commands for lots of types of lines, but when blobbing with <code>shape()</code>, we’ll define curves using the <code>curve</code> command:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  clip-path: shape(\r\n    from X0 Y0, \r\n    curve to X1 Y1 with Xc1 Yc1, \r\n    curve to X2 Y2 with Xc21 Yc21 / Xc22 Yc22\r\n    /* ... */\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s break down each parameter:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>X0 Y0</code> defines the starting point of the shape.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>curve</code> starts the curve where <code>X1 Y1</code> is the next point of the shape, while <code>Xc1 Yc1</code> defines a control point used in Bézier curves.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The next parameter is similar, but we used <code>Xc21 Yc21 / Xc22 Yc22</code> instead to define two control points on the Bézier curve.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I honestly don’t understand Bézier curves and control points completely, but luckily, we don’t need them to use <code>shape()</code> and blobs! Again, <code>shape()</code> uses a verbal version of SVG’s <code>path</code> syntax, so it can draw any shape an SVG can, which means that we can translate the SVG blobs we generated earlier… and CSS-ify them. To do so, we’ll grab the <code>d</code> attribute (which defines the <code>path</code>) from our SVG and paste it into Temani’s <a href=\"https://css-generators.com/svg-to-css/\" rel=\"noopener\">SVG to <code>shape()</code> generator</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is the exact code the tool generated for me:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  aspect-ratio: 0.925; /* Generated too! */\r\n\r\n  clip-path: shape(\r\n    from 91.52% 26.2%,\r\n    curve to 93.52% 78.28% with 101.76% 42.67%/103.09% 63.87%,\r\n    curve to 44.11% 99.97% with 83.95% 92.76%/63.47% 100.58%,\r\n    curve to 1.45% 78.42% with 24.74% 99.42%/6.42% 90.43%,\r\n    curve to 14.06% 35.46% with -3.45% 66.41%/4.93% 51.38%,\r\n    curve to 47.59% 0.33% with 23.18% 19.54%/33.13% 2.8%,\r\n    curve to 91.52% 26.2% with 62.14% -2.14%/81.28% 9.66%\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As you might have guessed, it returns our beautiful blob:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_MYwEjoX\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/MYwEjoX?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=MYwEjoX&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed MYwEjoX\" title=\"CodePen Embed MYwEjoX\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s check if it passes our requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Yes, they can be made of a single element.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Yes, they can also be created in a generator and then translated into CSS.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Yes, we can use gradient backgrounds, but due to the nature of <code>clip-path()</code>, borders and shadows get cut out.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Two out of three? Maybe two and a half of three? That’s a big improvement over the other approaches, even if it’s not perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, alas, we failed to find what I believe is the perfect CSS approach to blobs.

And when you repeat the same process over and over again, it’s only a question of how much you can optimize it, or in this case, what’s the easiest way to create blobs in CSS? Turns out, as always, there are many approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387089\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To know if our following blobs are worth using, we’ll need them to pass three tests:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>They can be with just a single element (and preferably without pseudos).</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>They can be easily designed (ideally through an online tool).</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>We can use gradient backgrounds, borders, shadows, and other CSS effects on them.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Without further ado, let’s <em>Blob, Blob, Blob</em> right in.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"just-generate-them-online\">Just generate them online</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I know it’s disenchanting to click on an article about making blobs in CSS just for me to say you can generate them outside CSS. Still, it’s probably the most common way to create blobs on the web, so to be thorough, these are some online tools I’ve used before to create <strong>SVG</strong> blobs.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://app.haikei.app/\" rel=\"noopener\">Haikei</a>.</strong> Probably the one I have used the most since, besides blobs, it can also generate lots of SVG backgrounds.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.blobmaker.app/\" rel=\"noopener\">Blobmaker</a>.</strong> A dedicated tool for making blobs. It’s apparently part of Haikei now, so you can use both.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Lastly, almost all graphic programs let you hand-draw blobs and export them as SVGs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For example, this is one I generated just now.

This technique isn’t new by any means; it was <a href=\"https://9elements.com/blog/css-border-radius-can-do-that/\" rel=\"noopener\">first described by Nils Binder</a> in 2018, but it is still fairly unknown. Even for those who use it, the inner workings are not entirely clear.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To start, you may know the <code>border-radius</code> is a shorthand to each individual corner’s radius, going from the top left corner clockwise. For example, we can set each corner’s <code>border-radius</code> to get a bubbly square shape:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><div class=\"blob\"></div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  border-radius: 25% 50% 75% 100%;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gbpRwZz\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/gbpRwZz?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=gbpRwZz&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gbpRwZz\" title=\"CodePen Embed gbpRwZz\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, what <code>border-radius</code> does — and also why it’s called “radius” — is to shape each corner following a circle of the given radius. For example, if we set the top left corner to <code>25%</code>, it will follow a circle with a radius <code>25%</code> the size of the shape.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  border-top-left-radius: 25%;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_VYLWGve\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/VYLWGve?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=VYLWGve&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed VYLWGve\" title=\"CodePen Embed VYLWGve\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What’s less known is that each corner property is still a <em>shortcut</em> towards its horizontal and vertical radii. Normally, you set both radii to the same value, getting a circle, but you can set them individually to create an ellipse. For example, the following sets the horizontal radius to <code>25%</code> of the element’s width and the vertical to <code>50%</code> of its height:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  border-top-left-radius: 25% 50%;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvOYOo\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvOYOo?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvOYOo&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvOYOo\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvOYOo\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can now shape each corner like an ellipse, and it is the combination of all four ellipses that creates the illusion of a blob! Just take into consideration that to use the horizontal and vertical radii syntax through the <code>border-radius</code> property, we’ll need to separate the horizontal from the vertical radii using a forward slash (<code>/</code>).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  border-radius:\r\n    /* horizontal */\r\n    100% 30% 60% 70% /\r\n    /* vertical */\r\n    50% 40% 70% 70%;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_dPoWMym\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/dPoWMym?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=dPoWMym&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed dPoWMym\" title=\"CodePen Embed dPoWMym\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The syntax isn’t too intuitive, so designing a blob from scratch will likely be a headache. Luckily, <a href=\"https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/\" rel=\"noopener\">Nils Binder made a tool</a> exactly for that!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"blobbing-blobs-together\">Blobbing blobs together</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This hack is awesome. We aren’t supposed to use <code>border-radius</code> like that, but we still do. Admittedly, we are limited to boring blobs. Due to the nature of <code>border-radius</code>, no matter how hard we try, we will only get convex shapes.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?resize=1024%2C576\" alt=\"Concave and convex shapes\" class=\"wp-image-387123\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?resize=1536%2C864&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?w=1920&ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Just going off <code>border-radius</code>, we can try to minimize it a little by sticking more than one blob together:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gbpxJKd\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/gbpxJKd?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=gbpxJKd&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gbpxJKd\" title=\"CodePen Embed gbpxJKd\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, I don’t want to spend too much time on this technique since it is too impractical to be worth it. To name a few drawbacks:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>We are using more than one element or, at the very least, an extra pseudo-element. Ideally, we want to keep it to one element.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>We don’t have a tool to prototype our blobby amalgamations, so making one is a process of trial and error.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>We can’t use borders, gradients, or box shadows since they would reveal the element’s outlines.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiple-backgrounds-and-svg-filters\">Multiple backgrounds and SVG filters</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This one is an improvement in the Gooey Effect, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/gooey-effect/\">described here by Lucas Bebber</a>, although I don’t know who first came up with it. In the original effect, several elements can be morphed together like drops of liquid sticking to and flowing out of each other:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_LELBEo\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/LELBEo?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=LELBEo&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed LELBEo\" title=\"CodePen Embed LELBEo\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It works by first blurring shapes nearby, creating some connected shadows. Then we crank up the contrast, forcing the blur out and smoothly connecting them in the process. Take, for example, this demo by Chris Coyer (It’s from 2014, so more than 10 years ago!):</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_poXpNL\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/poXpNL?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=poXpNL&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed poXpNL\" title=\"CodePen Embed poXpNL\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you look at the code, you’ll notice Chris uses the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/\"><code>filter</code></a> property along the <code>blur()</code> and <code>contrast()</code> functions, which I’ve also seen in other blob demos. To be specific, it applies <code>blur()</code> on each individual circle and then <code>contrast()</code> on the parent element. So, if we have the following HTML:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><div class=\"blob\">\r\n  <div class=\"subblob\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"subblob\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"subblob\"></div>\r\n</div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>…we would need to apply filters and background colors as such:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  filter: contrast(50);\r\n  background: white; /* Solid colors are necessary */\r\n}\r\n\r\n.subblob {\r\n  filter: blur(15px);\r\n  background: black; /* Solid colors are necessary */\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, there is a good reason why those demos stick to white shapes and black backgrounds (or vice versa) since things get unpredictable once colors aren’t contrast-y enough. See it for yourself in the following demo by changing the color. Just be wary: <em>shades get ugly</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_yyNomvx\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/yyNomvx?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=yyNomvx&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed yyNomvx\" title=\"CodePen Embed yyNomvx\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To solve this, we will use an SVG filter instead. I don’t want to get too technical on SVG (if you want to, read Luca’s post!). In a nutshell, we can apply blurring and contrast filters using SVGs, but now, we can also pick which color channel we apply the contrast to, unlike normal <code>contrast()</code>, which modifies all colors. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since we want to leave color channels (<code>R</code>, <code>G</code> and <code>B</code>) untouched, we will only crank the contrast up for the alpha channel. That translates to the next SVG filter, which can be embedded in the HTML:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.1\" style=\"position: absolute;\">\r\n  <defs>\r\n    <filter id=\"blob\">\r\n      <feGaussianBlur in=\"SourceGraphic\" stdDeviation=\"12\" result=\"blur\" />\r\n      <feColorMatrix in=\"blur\" mode=\"matrix\" values=\"1 0 0 0 0  0 1 0 0 0  0 0 1 0 0  0 0 0 18 -6\" result=\"goo\" />\r\n      <feBlend in=\"SourceGraphic\" in2=\"blob\" />\r\n    </filter>\r\n  </defs>\r\n</svg></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To apply it, we will use again <code>filter</code>, but this time we’ll set it to <code>url(\"#blob\")</code>, so that it pulls the SVG from the HTML.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  filter: url(\"#blob\");\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And now we can even use it with gradient backgrounds!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_MYwvNZL\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/MYwvNZL?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=MYwvNZL&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed MYwvNZL\" title=\"CodePen Embed MYwvNZL\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, this approach comes with two small, but important, changes to common CSS filters:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>The filter is applied to the parent element, not the individual shapes.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The parent element must be transparent (which is a huge advantage). To change the background color, we can instead change the body or other ancestors’ background, and it will work with no issues.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What’s left is to place the <code>.subblob</code> elements together such that they make a blobby enough shape, then apply the SVG filters to morph them:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_bNdrXZv\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/bNdrXZv?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=bNdrXZv&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed bNdrXZv\" title=\"CodePen Embed bNdrXZv\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"making-it-one-element\">Making it one element</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This works well, but it has a similar issue to the blob we made by morphing several <code>border-radius</code> instances: too many elements for a simple blob. Luckily, we can take advantage of the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/\"><code>background</code></a> property to create multiple shapes and morph them together using SVG filters, all in a single element. Since we are keeping it to one element, we will go back to just one empty <code>.blob</code> div:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><div class=\"blob\"></div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To recap, the <code>background</code> shorthand can set all background properties and also set multiple backgrounds at once. Of all the properties, we only care about the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-image/\"><code>background-image</code></a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/\"><code>background-position</code></a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-size/\"><code>background-size</code></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First, we will use <code>background-image</code> along with <code>radial-gradient()</code> to create a circle inside the element:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\r\n  background: radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000);\r\n  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Important! */\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_PwqJYZQ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/PwqJYZQ?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=PwqJYZQ&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed PwqJYZQ\" title=\"CodePen Embed PwqJYZQ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here is what each parameter does:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong><code>farthest-side</code>:</strong> Confines the shape to the element’s box farthest from its center. This way, it is kept as a circle.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong><code>var(--blob-color) 100%</code>:</strong> Fills the background shape from 0 to 100% with the same color, so it ends up as a solid color.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong><code>#0000</code>:</strong> After the shape is done, it makes a full stop to transparency, so the color ends.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The next part is moving and resizing the circle using the <code>background-position</code> and <code>background-size</code> properties. Luckily, both can be set on <code>background</code> after the gradient, separated from each other by a forward slash (<code>/</code>).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">body {\r\n  background: radial-gradient(...) 20% 30% / 30% 40%;\r\n  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Important! */\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_PwqJYzR\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/PwqJYzR?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=PwqJYzR&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed PwqJYzR\" title=\"CodePen Embed PwqJYzR\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The first pair of percentages sets the shape’s horizontal and vertical position (taking as a reference the top-left corner), while the second pair sets the shape’s width and height (taking as a reference the element’s size).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As I mentioned, we can stack up different backgrounds together, which means we can create as many circles/ellipses as we want! For example, we can create three ellipses on the same element:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  background:\r\n    radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000) 20% 30% / 30% 40%, \r\n    radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000) 80% 50% / 40% 60%, \r\n    radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000) 50% 70% / 50% 50%;\r\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What’s even better is that SVG filters don’t care whether shapes are made of elements or backgrounds, so we can also morph them together using the last <code>url(#blob)</code> filter!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_vEOJqLQ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/vEOJqLQ?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=vEOJqLQ&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed vEOJqLQ\" title=\"CodePen Embed vEOJqLQ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While this method may be a little too much for blobs, it unlocks squishing, stretching, dividing, and merging blobs <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/gooey-effect/#aa-making-things-stick\">in seamless animations</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Again, all these tricks are awesome, but not enough for what we want! We accomplished reducing the blob to a single element, but we still can’t use gradients, borders, or shadows on them, and also, they are tedious to design and model. Then, that brings us to the ultimate blob approach…</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"using-the-new-shape-function\">Using the <code>shape()</code> function</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, there is a new way to make blobs that just dropped to CSS: the <code>shape()</code> function!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I’ll explain <code>shape()</code>‘s syntax briefly, but for an in-depth explanation, you’ll want to check out both <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/shape/\">this explainer from the CSS-Tricks Almanac </a>as well as <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/author/afiftemani/\">Temani Afif</a>‘s three-part <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">series on the <code>shape()</code> function</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/blog/creating-blob-shapes-using-clip-path-shape/\" rel=\"noopener\">his recent article about blobs</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First off, the CSS <code>shape()</code> function is used alongside the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/clip-path/\"><code>clip-path</code></a> property to cut elements into any shape we want. More specifically, it uses a verbal version of SVG’s <code>path</code> syntax. The syntax has lots of commands for lots of types of lines, but when blobbing with <code>shape()</code>, we’ll define curves using the <code>curve</code> command:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  clip-path: shape(\r\n    from X0 Y0, \r\n    curve to X1 Y1 with Xc1 Yc1, \r\n    curve to X2 Y2 with Xc21 Yc21 / Xc22 Yc22\r\n    /* ... */\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s break down each parameter:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>X0 Y0</code> defines the starting point of the shape.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>curve</code> starts the curve where <code>X1 Y1</code> is the next point of the shape, while <code>Xc1 Yc1</code> defines a control point used in Bézier curves.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The next parameter is similar, but we used <code>Xc21 Yc21 / Xc22 Yc22</code> instead to define two control points on the Bézier curve.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I honestly don’t understand Bézier curves and control points completely, but luckily, we don’t need them to use <code>shape()</code> and blobs! Again, <code>shape()</code> uses a verbal version of SVG’s <code>path</code> syntax, so it can draw any shape an SVG can, which means that we can translate the SVG blobs we generated earlier… and CSS-ify them. To do so, we’ll grab the <code>d</code> attribute (which defines the <code>path</code>) from our SVG and paste it into Temani’s <a href=\"https://css-generators.com/svg-to-css/\" rel=\"noopener\">SVG to <code>shape()</code> generator</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is the exact code the tool generated for me:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blob {\r\n  aspect-ratio: 0.925; /* Generated too! */\r\n\r\n  clip-path: shape(\r\n    from 91.52% 26.2%,\r\n    curve to 93.52% 78.28% with 101.76% 42.67%/103.09% 63.87%,\r\n    curve to 44.11% 99.97% with 83.95% 92.76%/63.47% 100.58%,\r\n    curve to 1.45% 78.42% with 24.74% 99.42%/6.42% 90.43%,\r\n    curve to 14.06% 35.46% with -3.45% 66.41%/4.93% 51.38%,\r\n    curve to 47.59% 0.33% with 23.18% 19.54%/33.13% 2.8%,\r\n    curve to 91.52% 26.2% with 62.14% -2.14%/81.28% 9.66%\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As you might have guessed, it returns our beautiful blob:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_MYwEjoX\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/MYwEjoX?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=MYwEjoX&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed MYwEjoX\" title=\"CodePen Embed MYwEjoX\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s check if it passes our requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Yes, they can be made of a single element.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Yes, they can also be created in a generator and then translated into CSS.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Yes, we can use gradient backgrounds, but due to the nature of <code>clip-path()</code>, borders and shadows get cut out.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Two out of three? Maybe two and a half of three? That’s a big improvement over the other approaches, even if it’s not perfect.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, alas, we failed to find what I believe is the perfect CSS approach to blobs. I am, however, amazed how something so trivial designing blobs can teach us about so many tricks and new CSS features, many of which I didn’t know myself.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-blob-recipes/\">CSS Blob Recipes</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=css-tricks.com&utm_campaign=family_&utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

    "title": "Poking at the CSS if() Function a Little More: Conditional Color Theming",
    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/137\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrome 137</a> shipped the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals/\"><code>if()</code> CSS function</a>, so it’s totally possible we’ll see other browsers implement it, though it’s tough to know exactly when. Whatever the case, <code>if()</code> enables us to use values conditionally, which we can already do with queries and other functions (e.g., media queries and the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/light-dark/\"><code>light-dark()</code></a> function), so I’m sure you’re wondering: What exactly does <code>if()</code> do?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/lightly-poking-at-the-css-if-function-in-chrome-137/\">Sunkanmi gave us a nice overview of the function yesterday</a>, poking at the syntax at a high level. I’d like to poke at it a little harder in this article, getting into some possible real-world usage.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387215\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To recap, <code>if()</code> conditionally assigns a value to a property based on the value of a CSS variable. For example, we could assign different values to the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/color/\"><code>color</code></a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/\"><code>background</code></a> properties based on the value of <code>--theme</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>--theme</code>: <code>\"Shamrock\"</code>\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>color</code>: <code>‌hsl(146 50% 3%)</code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>background</code>: <code>hsl(146 50% 40%)</code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>--theme</code>: Anything else\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>color</code>: <code>hsl(43 74% 3%)</code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>background</code>: <code>hsl(43 74% 64%)</code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">:root {\r\n  /* Change to fall back to the ‘else’ values */\r\n  --theme: \"Shamrock\";\r\n\r\n  body {\r\n    color: if(style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 3%); else: hsl(43 74% 3%));\r\n    background: if(style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 40%); else: hsl(43 74% 64%));\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_ByNzRBZ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/ByNzRBZ?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=ByNzRBZ&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed ByNzRBZ\" title=\"CodePen Embed ByNzRBZ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don’t love the syntax (too many colons, brackets, and so on), but we can format it like this (which I think is a bit clearer):</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">color: if(\r\n  style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 3%);\r\n  else: hsl(43 74% 3%)\r\n);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We should be able to do a crazy number of things with <code>if()</code>, and I hope that becomes the case eventually, but I did some testing and learned that the syntax above is the only one that works. We can’t base the condition on the value of an ordinary CSS property (instead of a custom property), HTML attribute (using <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/a/attr/\"><code>attr()</code></a>), or any other value. For now, at least, the condition must be based on the value of a custom property (CSS variable).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exploring-what-we-can-do-with-if-\">Exploring what we can do with <code>if()</code></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Judging from that first example, it’s clear that we can use <code>if()</code> for theming (and design systems overall). While we could utilize the <code>light-dark()</code> function for this, what if the themes aren’t strictly light and dark, or what if we want to have more than two themes or light and dark modes for each theme? Well, that’s what <code>if()</code> can be used for.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First, let’s create more themes/more conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">:root {\r\n  /* Shamrock | Saffron | Amethyst */\r\n  --theme: \"Saffron\"; /* ...I choose you! */\r\n\r\n  body {\r\n    color: if(\r\n      style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 3%);\r\n      style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): hsl(43 74% 3%);\r\n      style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): hsl(282 47% 3%)\r\n    );\r\n    background: if(\r\n      style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 40%);\r\n      style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): hsl(43 74% 64%);\r\n      style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): hsl(282 47% 56%)\r\n    );\r\n    transition: 300ms;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty simple really, but there are a few easy-to-miss things. Firstly, there’s no “else condition” this time, which means that if the theme isn’t <code>Shamrock</code>, <code>Saffron</code>, or <code>Amethyst</code>, the default browser styles are used. Otherwise, the <code>if()</code> function <em>resolves to the value of the first true statement</em>, which is the <code>Saffron</code> theme in this case. Secondly, transitions work right out of the box; in the demo below, I’ve added a user interface for toggling the <code>--theme</code>, and for the transition, <em>literally</em> just <code>transition: 300ms</code> alongside the <code>if()</code> functions:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvpdMB\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvpdMB?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvpdMB&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvpdMB\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvpdMB\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Note:</strong> if theme-swapping is user-controlled, such as selecting an option, you don’t actually need <code>if()</code> at all. You can just use the logic that I’ve used at the beginning of the demo (<code>:root:has(#shamrock:checked) { /* Styles */ }</code>). Amit Sheen has an <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/05/combining-css-has-html-select-conditional-styling/\" rel=\"noopener\">excellent demonstration over at Smashing Magazine</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To make the code more maintainable though, we can slide the colors into CSS variables as well, then use them in the <code>if()</code> functions, <em>then</em> slide the <code>if()</code> functions themselves into CSS variables:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Setup */\r\n:root {\r\n  /* Shamrock | Saffron | Amethyst */\r\n  --theme: \"Shamrock\"; /* ...I choose you! */\r\n\r\n  /* Base colors */\r\n  --shamrock: hsl(146 50% 40%);\r\n  --saffron: hsl(43 74% 64%);\r\n  --amethyst: hsl(282 47% 56%);\r\n\r\n  /* Base colors, but at 3% lightness */\r\n  --shamrock-complementary: hsl(from var(--shamrock) h s 3%);\r\n  --saffron-complementary: hsl(from var(--saffron) h s 3%);\r\n  --amethyst-complementary: hsl(from var(--amethyst) h s 3%);\r\n\r\n  --background: if(\r\n    style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): var(--shamrock);\r\n    style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): var(--saffron);\r\n    style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): var(--amethyst)\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  --color: if(\r\n    style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): var(--shamrock-complementary);\r\n    style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): var(--saffron-complementary);\r\n    style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): var(--amethyst-complementary)\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  /* Usage */\r\n  body {\r\n    /* One variable, all ifs! */\r\n    background: var(--background);\r\n    color: var(--color);\r\n    accent-color: var(--color);\r\n\r\n    /* Can’t forget this! */\r\n    transition: 300ms;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_ogXemww\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/ogXemww?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=ogXemww&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed ogXemww\" title=\"CodePen Embed ogXemww\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As well as using CSS variables within the <code>if()</code> function, we can also nest other functions.

    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/137\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrome 137</a> shipped the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals/\"><code>if()</code> CSS function</a>, so it’s totally possible we’ll see other browsers implement it, though it’s tough to know exactly when. Whatever the case, <code>if()</code> enables us to use values conditionally, which we can already do with queries and other functions (e.g., media queries and the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/light-dark/\"><code>light-dark()</code></a> function), so I’m sure you’re wondering: What exactly does <code>if()</code> do?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/lightly-poking-at-the-css-if-function-in-chrome-137/\">Sunkanmi gave us a nice overview of the function yesterday</a>, poking at the syntax at a high level. I’d like to poke at it a little harder in this article, getting into some possible real-world usage.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387215\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To recap, <code>if()</code> conditionally assigns a value to a property based on the value of a CSS variable. For example, we could assign different values to the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/color/\"><code>color</code></a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/\"><code>background</code></a> properties based on the value of <code>--theme</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>--theme</code>: <code>\"Shamrock\"</code>\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>color</code>: <code>‌hsl(146 50% 3%)</code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>background</code>: <code>hsl(146 50% 40%)</code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>--theme</code>: Anything else\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>color</code>: <code>hsl(43 74% 3%)</code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>background</code>: <code>hsl(43 74% 64%)</code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">:root {\r\n  /* Change to fall back to the ‘else’ values */\r\n  --theme: \"Shamrock\";\r\n\r\n  body {\r\n    color: if(style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 3%); else: hsl(43 74% 3%));\r\n    background: if(style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 40%); else: hsl(43 74% 64%));\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_ByNzRBZ\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/ByNzRBZ?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=ByNzRBZ&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed ByNzRBZ\" title=\"CodePen Embed ByNzRBZ\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I don’t love the syntax (too many colons, brackets, and so on), but we can format it like this (which I think is a bit clearer):</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">color: if(\r\n  style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 3%);\r\n  else: hsl(43 74% 3%)\r\n);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We should be able to do a crazy number of things with <code>if()</code>, and I hope that becomes the case eventually, but I did some testing and learned that the syntax above is the only one that works. We can’t base the condition on the value of an ordinary CSS property (instead of a custom property), HTML attribute (using <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/a/attr/\"><code>attr()</code></a>), or any other value. For now, at least, the condition must be based on the value of a custom property (CSS variable).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exploring-what-we-can-do-with-if-\">Exploring what we can do with <code>if()</code></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Judging from that first example, it’s clear that we can use <code>if()</code> for theming (and design systems overall). While we could utilize the <code>light-dark()</code> function for this, what if the themes aren’t strictly light and dark, or what if we want to have more than two themes or light and dark modes for each theme? Well, that’s what <code>if()</code> can be used for.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First, let’s create more themes/more conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">:root {\r\n  /* Shamrock | Saffron | Amethyst */\r\n  --theme: \"Saffron\"; /* ...I choose you! */\r\n\r\n  body {\r\n    color: if(\r\n      style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 3%);\r\n      style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): hsl(43 74% 3%);\r\n      style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): hsl(282 47% 3%)\r\n    );\r\n    background: if(\r\n      style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 40%);\r\n      style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): hsl(43 74% 64%);\r\n      style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): hsl(282 47% 56%)\r\n    );\r\n    transition: 300ms;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pretty simple really, but there are a few easy-to-miss things. Firstly, there’s no “else condition” this time, which means that if the theme isn’t <code>Shamrock</code>, <code>Saffron</code>, or <code>Amethyst</code>, the default browser styles are used. Otherwise, the <code>if()</code> function <em>resolves to the value of the first true statement</em>, which is the <code>Saffron</code> theme in this case. Secondly, transitions work right out of the box; in the demo below, I’ve added a user interface for toggling the <code>--theme</code>, and for the transition, <em>literally</em> just <code>transition: 300ms</code> alongside the <code>if()</code> functions:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_WbvpdMB\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/WbvpdMB?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=WbvpdMB&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed WbvpdMB\" title=\"CodePen Embed WbvpdMB\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Note:</strong> if theme-swapping is user-controlled, such as selecting an option, you don’t actually need <code>if()</code> at all. You can just use the logic that I’ve used at the beginning of the demo (<code>:root:has(#shamrock:checked) { /* Styles */ }</code>). Amit Sheen has an <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/05/combining-css-has-html-select-conditional-styling/\" rel=\"noopener\">excellent demonstration over at Smashing Magazine</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To make the code more maintainable though, we can slide the colors into CSS variables as well, then use them in the <code>if()</code> functions, <em>then</em> slide the <code>if()</code> functions themselves into CSS variables:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Setup */\r\n:root {\r\n  /* Shamrock | Saffron | Amethyst */\r\n  --theme: \"Shamrock\"; /* ...I choose you! */\r\n\r\n  /* Base colors */\r\n  --shamrock: hsl(146 50% 40%);\r\n  --saffron: hsl(43 74% 64%);\r\n  --amethyst: hsl(282 47% 56%);\r\n\r\n  /* Base colors, but at 3% lightness */\r\n  --shamrock-complementary: hsl(from var(--shamrock) h s 3%);\r\n  --saffron-complementary: hsl(from var(--saffron) h s 3%);\r\n  --amethyst-complementary: hsl(from var(--amethyst) h s 3%);\r\n\r\n  --background: if(\r\n    style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): var(--shamrock);\r\n    style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): var(--saffron);\r\n    style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): var(--amethyst)\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  --color: if(\r\n    style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): var(--shamrock-complementary);\r\n    style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): var(--saffron-complementary);\r\n    style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): var(--amethyst-complementary)\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  /* Usage */\r\n  body {\r\n    /* One variable, all ifs! */\r\n    background: var(--background);\r\n    color: var(--color);\r\n    accent-color: var(--color);\r\n\r\n    /* Can’t forget this! */\r\n    transition: 300ms;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_ogXemww\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/ogXemww?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=ogXemww&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed ogXemww\" title=\"CodePen Embed ogXemww\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As well as using CSS variables within the <code>if()</code> function, we can also nest other functions.

    "content": "<p>We’ve known it for a few weeks now, but the CSS <code>if()</code> function <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/quick-hit-49/\">officially shipped in Chrome 137 version</a>. It’s really fast development for a feature that <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals/\">the CSSWG resolved to add less than a year ago</a>. We can typically expect this sort of thing — especially one that is unlike anything we currently have in CSS — to develop over a number of years before we can get our dirty hands on it. But here we are!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I’m not here to debate whether <code>if()</code> in CSS should exist, nor do I want to answer whether CSS is a programming language; <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/is-css-a-programming-language/\">Chris already did that</a> and definitely explained how exhausting that <em>fun </em>little argument can be.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What I <em>am</em> here to do is poke at <code>if()</code> in these early days of support and explore what we know about it today at a pretty high level to get a feel for its syntax. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/poking-at-the-css-if-function-a-little-more-conditional-color-theming/\">We poke a little harder at it in another post</a> where we’ll look at a more heady real-world example.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387422\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"it-s-finally-here-\">Yes, it’s already here!</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Conditional statements exist everywhere in CSS. From at-rules to the parsing and matching of every statement to the DOM, CSS has always had conditionals. And, <a href=\"https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/css-conditionals/\" rel=\"noopener\">as Lea Verou put it</a>, every selector is essentially a conditional! What we haven’t had, however, is a way to style an element against multiple conditions in one line, and then have it return a result <em>conditionally</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>if()</code> function is a more advanced level of conditionals, where you can manipulate and have all your conditional statements assigned to a single property.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.element {\r\n  color: if(style(--theme: dark): oklch(52% 0.18 140); else: oklch(65% 0.05 220));\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_NPPZjPX\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/NPPZjPX?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=NPPZjPX&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed NPPZjPX\" title=\"CodePen Embed NPPZjPX\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-if-work-\">How does <code>if()</code> work?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Well before Chrome implemented the feature, back in 2021 when it was first proposed, the early syntax was like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><if()> = if( <container-query>, [<declaration-value>]{1, 2} )</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now we’re looking at this instead:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><if()> = if(\r\n  [<if-statement>: <result>]*;\r\n  <if-statement>: <result> ;?\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Where…</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>The first <code><if-statement></code> represents conditions inside either <code>style()</code>, <code>media()</code>, or <code>supports()</code> wrapper functions. This allows us to write multiple if statements, as many as we may desire. Yes, you read that right. As many as we want!</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The final <code><if-statement></code> condition (<code>else</code>) is the default value when all other if statements fail.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s the “easy” way to read the syntax. This is what’s <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-5/#if-notation\" rel=\"noopener\">in the spec</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><if()> = if( [ <if-branch> ; ]* <if-branch> ;? )\r\n<if-branch> = <if-condition> : <declaration-value>?\r\n<if-condition> = <boolean-expr[ <if-test> ]> | else\r\n<if-test> =\r\n  supports( [ <ident> : <declaration-value> ] | <supports-condition> )\r\n  media( <media-feature> | <media-condition> ) |\r\n  style( <style-query> )</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A little wordy, right? So, let’s look at an example to wrap our heads around it. Say we want to change an element’s padding depending on a given active color scheme. We would set an <code>if()</code> statement with a <code>style()</code> function inside, and that would compare a given value with something like a custom variable to output a result. All this talk sounds so complicated, so let’s jump into code:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.element {\r\n  padding: if(style(--theme: dark): 2rem; else: 3rem);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The example above sets the padding to <code>2rem</code>… <em>if</em> the <code>--theme</code> variable is set to <code>dark</code>. <em>If</em> not, it defaults to <code>3rem</code>. I know, not exactly the sort of thing you might actually use the function for, but it’s merely to illustrate the basic idea.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"make-the-syntax-clean-\">Make the syntax clean!</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One thing I noticed, though, is that things can get convoluted very <em>very</em> fast. Imagine you have three <code>if()</code> statements like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">:root {\r\n  --height: 12.5rem;\r\n  --width: 4rem;\r\n  --weight: 2rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.element {\r\n  height: if(\r\n    style(--height: 3rem): 14.5rem; style(--width: 7rem): 10rem; style(--weight: 100rem): 2rem; else: var(--height)\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We’re only working with three statements and, I’ll be honest, it makes my eyes hurt with complexity. So, I’m anticipating <code>if()</code> style patterns to be developed soon or <em>prettier</em> versions to adopt a formatting style for this.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if I were to break things out to be more readable, I would likely do something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">:root {\r\n  --height: 12.5rem;\r\n  --width: 4rem;\r\n  --weight: 2rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* This is much cleaner, don't you think? */\r\n.element {\r\n  height: if(\r\n    style(--height: 3rem): 14.5rem; \r\n    style(--width: 7rem): 10rem; \r\n    style(--weight: 100rem): 2rem; \r\n    else: var(--height)\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Much better, right? Now, you can definitely understand what is going on at a glance. That’s just me, though. Maybe you have different ideas… and <em>if</em> you do, I’d love to see them in the comments.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s a quick demo showing multiple conditionals in CSS for this animated ball to work. The width of the ball changes based on some custom variable values set. Gentle reminder that this is only supported in Chrome 137+ at the time I’m writing this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_yyNNbZX\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/yyNNbZX?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=yyNNbZX&default-tab=css,result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed yyNNbZX\" title=\"CodePen Embed yyNNbZX\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-supports-and-media-work-in-if-\">The <code>supports()</code> and <code>media()</code> statements</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Think of <code>supports()</code> the same way you would use the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/s/supports/\"><code>@supports</code></a> at-rule. In fact, they work about the same, at least conceptually:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* formal syntax for @supports */\r\n@supports <supports-condition> {\r\n  <rule-list>\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* formal syntax for supports() */\r\nsupports( [ <ident> : <declaration-value> ] | <supports-condition> )</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The only difference here is that <code>supports()</code> returns a value instead of matching a block of code. But, how does this work in <em>real code?</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>The <code><ident>: <declaration-value></code> you see here is, in this case, the <strong>property name: property value</strong> e.g. <code>display: flex</code>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s say you want to check for support for the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/backdrop-filter/\">backdrop-filter</a></code> property, particularly the <code>blur()</code> function. Typically, you can do this with <code>@supports</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Fallback in case the browser doesn't support backdrop-filter */\r\n.card {\r\n  backdrop-filter: unset;\r\n  background-color: oklch(20% 50% 40% / 0.8);\r\n}\r\n\r\n@supports (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) {\r\n  .card {\r\n    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);\r\n    background-color: oklch(20% 50% 40% / 0.8);\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But, with CSS <code>if()</code>, we can also do this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.card {\r\n  backdrop-filter: if(\r\n    supports(backdrop-filter: blur(10px)): blur(10px);\r\n    else: unset\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Note:</strong> Think of <code>unset</code> here as a possible fallback for graceful degradation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That looks awesome, right? Multiple conditions can be checked as well for <code>supports()</code> and any of the supported functions. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.card {\r\n  backdrop-filter: if(\r\n    supports(backdrop-filter: blur(10px)): blur(10px);\r\n    supports(backdrop-filter: invert(50%)): invert(50%);\r\n    supports(backdrop-filter: hue-rotate(230deg)): hue-rotate(230deg);;\r\n    else: unset\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, take a look at the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/m/media/\">@media</a></code> at-rule. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/\">You can compare and check for a bunch of stuff</a>, but I’d like to keep it simple and check for whether or not a screen size is a certain width and apply styles based on that:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">h1 {\r\n  font-size: 2rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\r\n  h1 {\r\n    font-size: 2.5rem;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (min-width: 1200px) {\r\n  h1 {\r\n    font-size: 3rem;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>media()</code> wrapper works almost the same way as its at-rule counterpart. Note its syntax from the spec:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* formal syntax for @media */\r\n@media <media-query-list> {\r\n  <rule-list>\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* formal syntax for media() */\r\nmedia( <media-feature> | <media-condition> )</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Notice how at the <em>end of the day</em>, the formal syntax (<code><media-query></code>) is the same as the syntax for the <code>media()</code> function. And instead of returning a block of code in <code>@media</code>, you’d have something like this in the CSS inline <code>if()</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">h1 {\r\n  font-size: if(\r\n    media(width >= 1200px): 3rem;\r\n    media(width >= 768px): 2.5rem;\r\n    else: 2rem\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-is-browser-support-for-if-\">Again, these are early days</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As of the time of this writing, only the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=if(\" rel=\"noopener\">latest update of Chrome supports <code>if()</code></a>).

    "title": "Lightly Poking at the CSS if() Function in Chrome 137",
    "content": "<p>We’ve known it for a few weeks now, but the CSS <code>if()</code> function <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/quick-hit-49/\">officially shipped in Chrome 137 version</a>. It’s really fast development for a feature that <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals/\">the CSSWG resolved to add less than a year ago</a>. We can typically expect this sort of thing — especially one that is unlike anything we currently have in CSS — to develop over a number of years before we can get our dirty hands on it. But here we are!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I’m not here to debate whether <code>if()</code> in CSS should exist, nor do I want to answer whether CSS is a programming language; <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/is-css-a-programming-language/\">Chris already did that</a> and definitely explained how exhausting that <em>fun </em>little argument can be.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What I <em>am</em> here to do is poke at <code>if()</code> in these early days of support and explore what we know about it today at a pretty high level to get a feel for its syntax. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/poking-at-the-css-if-function-a-little-more-conditional-color-theming/\">We poke a little harder at it in another post</a> where we’ll look at a more heady real-world example.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387422\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"it-s-finally-here-\">Yes, it’s already here!</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Conditional statements exist everywhere in CSS. From at-rules to the parsing and matching of every statement to the DOM, CSS has always had conditionals. And, <a href=\"https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/css-conditionals/\" rel=\"noopener\">as Lea Verou put it</a>, every selector is essentially a conditional! What we haven’t had, however, is a way to style an element against multiple conditions in one line, and then have it return a result <em>conditionally</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>if()</code> function is a more advanced level of conditionals, where you can manipulate and have all your conditional statements assigned to a single property.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.element {\r\n  color: if(style(--theme: dark): oklch(52% 0.18 140); else: oklch(65% 0.05 220));\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_NPPZjPX\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/NPPZjPX?height=500&theme-id=1&slug-hash=NPPZjPX&default-tab=result\" height=\"500\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed NPPZjPX\" title=\"CodePen Embed NPPZjPX\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-if-work-\">How does <code>if()</code> work?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Well before Chrome implemented the feature, back in 2021 when it was first proposed, the early syntax was like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><if()> = if( <container-query>, [<declaration-value>]{1, 2} )</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now we’re looking at this instead:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><if()> = if(\r\n  [<if-statement>: <result>]*;\r\n  <if-statement>: <result> ;?\r\n)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Where…</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>The first <code><if-statement></code> represents conditions inside either <code>style()</code>, <code>media()</code>, or <code>supports()</code> wrapper functions. This allows us to write multiple if statements, as many as we may desire. Yes, you read that right. As many as we want!</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The final <code><if-statement></code> condition (<code>else</code>) is the default value when all other if statements fail.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That’s the “easy” way to read the syntax. This is what’s <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-5/#if-notation\" rel=\"noopener\">in the spec</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><if()> = if( [ <if-branch> ; ]* <if-branch> ;? )\r\n<if-branch> = <if-condition> : <declaration-value>?\r\n<if-condition> = <boolean-expr[ <if-test> ]> | else\r\n<if-test> =\r\n  supports( [ <ident> : <declaration-value> ] | <supports-condition> )\r\n  media( <media-feature> | <media-condition> ) |\r\n  style( <style-query> )</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A little wordy, right? So, let’s look at an example to wrap our heads around it. Say we want to change an element’s padding depending on a given active color scheme. We would set an <code>if()</code> statement with a <code>style()</code> function inside, and that would compare a given value with something like a custom variable to output a result. All this talk sounds so complicated, so let’s jump into code:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.element {\r\n  padding: if(style(--theme: dark): 2rem; else: 3rem);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The example above sets the padding to <code>2rem</code>… <em>if</em> the <code>--theme</code> variable is set to <code>dark</code>. <em>If</em> not, it defaults to <code>3rem</code>. I know, not exactly the sort of thing you might actually use the function for, but it’s merely to illustrate the basic idea.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"make-the-syntax-clean-\">Make the syntax clean!</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One thing I noticed, though, is that things can get convoluted very <em>very</em> fast. Imagine you have three <code>if()</code> statements like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">:root {\r\n  --height: 12.5rem;\r\n  --width: 4rem;\r\n  --weight: 2rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.element {\r\n  height: if(\r\n    style(--height: 3rem): 14.5rem; style(--width: 7rem): 10rem; style(--weight: 100rem): 2rem; else: var(--height)\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We’re only working with three statements and, I’ll be honest, it makes my eyes hurt with complexity. So, I’m anticipating <code>if()</code> style patterns to be developed soon or <em>prettier</em> versions to adopt a formatting style for this.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if I were to break things out to be more readable, I would likely do something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">:root {\r\n  --height: 12.5rem;\r\n  --width: 4rem;\r\n  --weight: 2rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* This is much cleaner, don't you think? */\r\n.element {\r\n  height: if(\r\n    style(--height: 3rem): 14.5rem; \r\n    style(--width: 7rem): 10rem; \r\n    style(--weight: 100rem): 2rem; \r\n    else: var(--height)\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Much better, right? Now, you can definitely understand what is going on at a glance. That’s just me, though. Maybe you have different ideas… and <em>if</em> you do, I’d love to see them in the comments.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Here’s a quick demo showing multiple conditionals in CSS for this animated ball to work. The width of the ball changes based on some custom variable values set. Gentle reminder that this is only supported in Chrome 137+ at the time I’m writing this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_yyNNbZX\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/yyNNbZX?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=yyNNbZX&default-tab=css,result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed yyNNbZX\" title=\"CodePen Embed yyNNbZX\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-supports-and-media-work-in-if-\">The <code>supports()</code> and <code>media()</code> statements</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Think of <code>supports()</code> the same way you would use the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/s/supports/\"><code>@supports</code></a> at-rule. In fact, they work about the same, at least conceptually:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* formal syntax for @supports */\r\n@supports <supports-condition> {\r\n  <rule-list>\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* formal syntax for supports() */\r\nsupports( [ <ident> : <declaration-value> ] | <supports-condition> )</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The only difference here is that <code>supports()</code> returns a value instead of matching a block of code. But, how does this work in <em>real code?</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>The <code><ident>: <declaration-value></code> you see here is, in this case, the <strong>property name: property value</strong> e.g. <code>display: flex</code>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s say you want to check for support for the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/backdrop-filter/\">backdrop-filter</a></code> property, particularly the <code>blur()</code> function. Typically, you can do this with <code>@supports</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* Fallback in case the browser doesn't support backdrop-filter */\r\n.card {\r\n  backdrop-filter: unset;\r\n  background-color: oklch(20% 50% 40% / 0.8);\r\n}\r\n\r\n@supports (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) {\r\n  .card {\r\n    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);\r\n    background-color: oklch(20% 50% 40% / 0.8);\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But, with CSS <code>if()</code>, we can also do this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.card {\r\n  backdrop-filter: if(\r\n    supports(backdrop-filter: blur(10px)): blur(10px);\r\n    else: unset\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Note:</strong> Think of <code>unset</code> here as a possible fallback for graceful degradation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>That looks awesome, right? Multiple conditions can be checked as well for <code>supports()</code> and any of the supported functions. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.card {\r\n  backdrop-filter: if(\r\n    supports(backdrop-filter: blur(10px)): blur(10px);\r\n    supports(backdrop-filter: invert(50%)): invert(50%);\r\n    supports(backdrop-filter: hue-rotate(230deg)): hue-rotate(230deg);;\r\n    else: unset\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, take a look at the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/m/media/\">@media</a></code> at-rule. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/\">You can compare and check for a bunch of stuff</a>, but I’d like to keep it simple and check for whether or not a screen size is a certain width and apply styles based on that:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">h1 {\r\n  font-size: 2rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\r\n  h1 {\r\n    font-size: 2.5rem;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (min-width: 1200px) {\r\n  h1 {\r\n    font-size: 3rem;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>media()</code> wrapper works almost the same way as its at-rule counterpart. Note its syntax from the spec:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">/* formal syntax for @media */\r\n@media <media-query-list> {\r\n  <rule-list>\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* formal syntax for media() */\r\nmedia( <media-feature> | <media-condition> )</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Notice how at the <em>end of the day</em>, the formal syntax (<code><media-query></code>) is the same as the syntax for the <code>media()</code> function. And instead of returning a block of code in <code>@media</code>, you’d have something like this in the CSS inline <code>if()</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">h1 {\r\n  font-size: if(\r\n    media(width >= 1200px): 3rem;\r\n    media(width >= 768px): 2.5rem;\r\n    else: 2rem\r\n  );\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-is-browser-support-for-if-\">Again, these are early days</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As of the time of this writing, only the <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=if(\" rel=\"noopener\">latest update of Chrome supports <code>if()</code></a>).

Again, you have to:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Create a new observer:</strong> with the <code>new</code> keyword.

We’ve already published several with more on the way, including a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-color-functions/\">complete guide on color functions</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/c/color/\">color()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/h/hsl/\">hsl()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/lab/\">lab()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/lch/\">lch()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklab/\">oklab()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklch/\">oklch()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/r/rgb/\">rgb()</a></code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And I must admit: I didn’t know a lot about color in CSS (I still used <code>rgb()</code>, which apparently isn’t what cool people do anymore), so it has been a fun learning experience. One of the things I noticed while trying to keep up with all this new information was how long the glossary of color goes, especially the “color” concepts. There are “color spaces,” “color models,” “color gamuts,” and basically a “color” something for everything.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>They are all somewhat related, and it can get confusing as you dig into using color in CSS, especially the new color functions that have been shipped lately, like <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/exploring-the-css-contrast-color-function-a-second-time/\">contrast-color()</a></code> and <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/color-mixing-with-animation-composition/\">color-mix()</a></code>. Hence, I wanted to make the glossary I wish I had when I was hearing for the first time about each concept, and that anyone can check whenever they forget what a specific “color” thing is.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-386925\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As a disclaimer, I am not trying to explain color, or specifically, color reproduction, in this post; that would probably be impossible for a mortal like me. Instead, I want to give you a big enough picture for some technicalities behind color in CSS, such that you feel confident using functions like <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/lab/\">lab()</a></code> or <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklch/\">oklch()</a></code> while also understanding what makes them special.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-s-a-color-\">What’s a color?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s slow down first. In order to understand <em>everything</em> in <em>color</em>, we first need to understand the <em>color</em> in <em>everything</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"footnote-1\">While it’s useful to think about an object being a certain color (watch out for the <em>red</em> car, or cut the <em>white</em> cable!), color isn’t a physical property of objects, or even a tangible thing. Yes, we can characterize <em>light</em> as the main cause of color<sup><a href=\"#note-1\">1</a></sup>, but it isn’t until visible light enters our eyes and is interpreted by our brains that we perceive a color. As said by <a href=\"https://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/xyz-rgb.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Elle Stone</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>Light waves are out there in the world, but color happens in the interaction between light waves and the eye, brain, and mind.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Even if color isn’t a physical thing, we still want to replicate it as reliably as possible, especially in the digital era. If we take a photo of a beautiful bouquet of lilies (like the one on my desk) and then display it on a screen, we expect to see the same colors in both the image and reality. However, “reality” here is a misleading term since, once again, the <em>reality</em> of color depends on the viewer. To solve this, we need to understand how light wavelengths (something measurable and replicable) create different color responses in viewers (something not so measurable).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, this task was already carried out 95 years ago by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE, by its French name). I wish I could get into the details of the experiment, but we haven’t gotten into our first color thingie yet. What’s important is that from these measurements, the CIE was able to map all the colors visible to the average human (in the experiment) to light wavelengths and describe them with only three values.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"footnote-2\">Initially, those three primary values corresponded to the red, green, and blue wavelengths used in the experiment, and they made up the CIERGB <em>Color Space</em>, but researchers noticed that some colors required a negative wavelength<sup><a href=\"#note-2\" data-type=\"internal\" data-id=\"#note-2\">2</a></sup> to represent a visible color. To avoid that, a series of transformations were performed on the original CIERGB and the resulting color space was called CIEXYZ.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This new color space also has three values, X and Z represent the chromaticity of a color, while Y represents its luminance. Since it has three axes, it makes a 3D shape, but if we slice it such that its luminance is the same, we get all the visible colors for a given luminance in a figure you have probably seen before.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"742\" height=\"789\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png?resize=742%2C789&ssl=1\" alt=\"xy chromaticitydiagram showing all visible colors \" class=\"wp-image-386928\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png?w=742&ssl=1 742w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png?resize=282%2C300&ssl=1 282w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is called the <em>xy chromaticity</em> diagram and holds <em>all</em> the colors visible by the average human eye (based on the average viewer in the CIE 1931 experiment). Colors inside the shape are considered real, while those outside are deemed imaginary.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-spaces\">Color Spaces</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of the last explanation was to reach the CIEXYZ Color Space concept, but what exactly is a “color space”? And why is the CIEXYZ <em>Color Space</em> so important?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The CIEXYZ Color Space is a mapping from all the colors visible by the average human eye into a 3D coordinate system, so we only need three values to define a color. Then, a <strong>color space can be thought of as a general mapping of color</strong>, with no need to include every visible color, and it is usually defined through three values as well.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rgb-color-spaces\">RGB Color Spaces</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The most well-known color spaces are the RGB color spaces (note the plural). As you may guess from the name, here we only need the amount of red, green, and blue to describe a color. And to describe an RGB color space, we only need to define its “reddest”, “greenest”, and “bluest” values<sup id=\"footnote-3\"><a href=\"#note-3\">3</a></sup>. If we use coordinates going from 0 to 1 to define a color in the RGB color space, then:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>(1, 0, 0)</code> means the reddest color.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>(0, 1, 0)</code> means the greenest color.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>(0, 0, 1)</code> means the bluest color.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, “reddest”, “bluest”, and “greenest” are only arbitrary descriptions of color. What makes a color the “bluest” is up to each person. For example, which of the following colors do you think is the bluest?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1-1024x1024.png?resize=1024%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Different shades of blue\" class=\"wp-image-386929\" style=\"object-fit:cover;width:300px;height:300px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=1024%2C1024&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=768%2C768&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?w=1200&ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As you can guess, something like “bluest” is an appalling description. Luckily, we just have to look back at the CIEXYZ color space — it’s pretty useful! Here, we can define what we consider the reddest, greenest, and bluest colors just as coordinates inside the xy chromaticity diagram. That’s all it takes to create an RGB color space, and why there are so many!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"583\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png?resize=768%2C583&ssl=1\" alt=\"sRGV and WideGamutRGB in the xy chromaticity diagram\" class=\"wp-image-386930\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png?w=768&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png?resize=300%2C228&ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: <a href=\"https://ninedegreesbelow.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Elle Stone</a></figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In CSS, the most used color space is the standard RGB (sRGB) color space, which, as you can see in the last image, leaves a lot of colors out. However, in CSS, we can use modern RGB color spaces with a lot more colors through the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/c/color/\"><code>color()</code></a> function, such as <code>display-p3</code>, <code>prophoto-rgb</code>, and <code>rec2020</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1473\" height=\"1194\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=1473%2C1194&ssl=1\" alt=\"Comparing the shapes of various color spaces, including sRGB, Display P3, A98-RGB, Rec2020, and ProPhoto.\" class=\"wp-image-386931\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?w=1473&ssl=1 1473w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=300%2C243&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=1024%2C830&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=768%2C623&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Chrome Developer Team</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\">Notice how the ProPhoto RGB color space goes out of the visible color. This is okay. Colors outside are clamped; they aren’t new or invisible colors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In CSS, besides sRGB, we have two more color spaces: the CIELAB color space and the Oklab color space. Luckily, once we understood what the CIEXYZ color space is, then these two should be simpler to understand. Let’s dig into that next.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cielab-and-oklab-color-spaces\">CIELAB and Oklab Color Spaces</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As we saw before, the sRGB color space lacks many of the colors visible by the average human eye. And as modern screens got better at displaying more colors, CSS needed to adopt newer color spaces to fully take advantage of those newer displays. That wasn’t the only problem with sRGB — it also lacks perceptual uniformity, meaning that changes in the color’s chromaticity also change its perceived lightness. Check, for example, this <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/high-definition-css-color-guide#overview\" rel=\"noopener\">demo by Adam Argyle</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_poZgXxy\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/poZgXxy?height=950&theme-id=1&slug-hash=poZgXxy&default-tab=result\" height=\"950\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed poZgXxy\" title=\"CodePen Embed poZgXxy\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Created in 1976 by the CIE, CIELAB, derived from CIEXYZ, also encompasses all the colors visible by the human eye. It works with three coordinates: L for perceptual lightness, a for the amount of red-green, and b* for the amount of yellow-blue in the color.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"726\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lab-color-space.jpg?resize=726%2C450&ssl=1\" alt=\"A diagram in the shape of a sphere containing a range of colors that go from white to black vertically and green to blue to yellow to red horizontally.\" class=\"wp-image-386933\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lab-color-space.jpg?w=726&ssl=1 726w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lab-color-space.jpg?resize=300%2C186&ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Linshang Technology</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It has a way better perceptual uniformity than sRGB, but it still isn’t completely uniform, especially in gradients involving blue. For example, in the following white-to-blue gradient, CIELAB shifts towards purple.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"592\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png?resize=592%2C192&ssl=1\" alt=\"Comparing blue gradients in Oklahoma and CIELAB.

Oklab also uses the three <code>L*a*b*</code> coordinates. Thanks to all these improvements, it is the color space I try to use the most lately.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-models\">Color Models</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When I was learning about these concepts, my biggest challenge after understanding color spaces was not getting them confused with color models and color gamuts. These two concepts, while complementary and closely related to color spaces, aren’t the same, so they are a common pitfall when learning about color.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A <strong><dfn>color model</dfn></strong> refers to the mathematical description of color through tuples of numbers, usually involving three numbers, but these values don’t give us an exact color until we pair them with a color space. For example, you know that in the RGB color model, we define color through three values: red, green, and blue. However, it isn’t until we match it to an RGB color space (e.g., sRGB with display-p3) that we have a color. In this sense, a color space can have several color models, like sRGB, which uses RGB, HSL, and HWB. At the same time, a color model can be used in several color spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I found plenty of articles and tutorials where “color spaces” and “color models” were used interchangeably. And some places were they had a different definition of color spaces and models than the one provided here. For example, Chrome’s <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/high-definition-css-color-guide#what_is_a_color_space\" rel=\"noopener\">High definition CSS color guide</a> defines CSS’s RGB and HSL as different color spaces, while MDN’s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_space#rgb_color_spaces\" rel=\"noopener\">Color Space entry</a> does define RGB and HSL as part of the sRGB color space.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Personally, in CSS, I find it easier to understand the idea of RGB, HSL and HWB as different models to access the sRGB color space.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-gamuts\">Color Gamuts</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A <strong><dfn>color gamut</dfn></strong> is more straightforward to explain. You may have noticed how we have talked about a color space having more colors than another, but it would be more correct to say it has a “wider” gamut, since a color gamut is the range of colors available in a color space. However, a color gamut isn’t only restricted by color space boundaries, but also by physical limitations. For example, an older screen may decrease the color gamut since it isn’t able to display each color available in a given color space. In this case where a color can’t be represented (due to physical limitation or being outside the color space itself), it’s said to be “out of gamut”.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-functions\">Color Functions</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In CSS, the only color space available used to be sRGB. Nowadays, we can work with a lot of modern color spaces through their respective color functions. As a quick reference, each of the color spaces in CSS uses the following functions:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>sRGB:</strong> We can work in sRGB using the ol’ hexadecimal notation, named colors, and the <code>rgb()</code>, <code>rgba()</code>, <code>hsl()</code>, <code>hsla()</code> and <code>hwb()</code> functions.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>CIELAB:</strong> Here we have the <code>lab()</code> for Cartesian coordinates and <code>lch()</code> for polar coordinates.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Oklab:</strong> Similar to CIELAB, we have <code>oklab()</code> for Cartesian coordinates and <code>oklch()</code> for polar coordinates.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>More through the <code>color()</code> and <code>color-mix()</code>.</strong> Outside these three color spaces, we can use many more using the <code>color()</code> and <code>color-mix()</code> functions. Specifically, we can use the RGB color spaces: <code>rgb-linear</code>, <code>display-p3</code>, <code>a98-rgb</code>, <code>prophoto-rgb</code>, <code>rec2020</code> and the XYZ color space: <code>xyz</code>, <code>xyz-d50</code>, or <code>xyz-d65</code>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tl-dr\">TL;DR</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Color spaces</strong> are a mapping between available colors and a coordinate system. In CSS, we have three main color spaces: sRGB, CIELAB, and Oklab, but many more are accessible through the <code>color()</code> function.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Color models</strong> define color with tuples of numbers, but they don’t give us information about the actual color until we pair them with a color space. For example, the RGB model doesn’t mean anything until we assign it an RGB color space.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Most of the time, we want to talk about how many colors a color space holds, so we use the term <strong>color gamut</strong> for the task. However, a color gamut is also tied to the physical limitations of a camera/display.

We’ve already published several with more on the way, including a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-color-functions/\">complete guide on color functions</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/c/color/\">color()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/h/hsl/\">hsl()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/lab/\">lab()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/lch/\">lch()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklab/\">oklab()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklch/\">oklch()</a></code></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/r/rgb/\">rgb()</a></code></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And I must admit: I didn’t know a lot about color in CSS (I still used <code>rgb()</code>, which apparently isn’t what cool people do anymore), so it has been a fun learning experience. One of the things I noticed while trying to keep up with all this new information was how long the glossary of color goes, especially the “color” concepts. There are “color spaces,” “color models,” “color gamuts,” and basically a “color” something for everything.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>They are all somewhat related, and it can get confusing as you dig into using color in CSS, especially the new color functions that have been shipped lately, like <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/exploring-the-css-contrast-color-function-a-second-time/\">contrast-color()</a></code> and <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/color-mixing-with-animation-composition/\">color-mix()</a></code>. Hence, I wanted to make the glossary I wish I had when I was hearing for the first time about each concept, and that anyone can check whenever they forget what a specific “color” thing is.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-386925\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As a disclaimer, I am not trying to explain color, or specifically, color reproduction, in this post; that would probably be impossible for a mortal like me. Instead, I want to give you a big enough picture for some technicalities behind color in CSS, such that you feel confident using functions like <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/lab/\">lab()</a></code> or <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklch/\">oklch()</a></code> while also understanding what makes them special.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-s-a-color-\">What’s a color?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s slow down first. In order to understand <em>everything</em> in <em>color</em>, we first need to understand the <em>color</em> in <em>everything</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"footnote-1\">While it’s useful to think about an object being a certain color (watch out for the <em>red</em> car, or cut the <em>white</em> cable!), color isn’t a physical property of objects, or even a tangible thing. Yes, we can characterize <em>light</em> as the main cause of color<sup><a href=\"#note-1\">1</a></sup>, but it isn’t until visible light enters our eyes and is interpreted by our brains that we perceive a color. As said by <a href=\"https://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/xyz-rgb.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Elle Stone</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>Light waves are out there in the world, but color happens in the interaction between light waves and the eye, brain, and mind.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Even if color isn’t a physical thing, we still want to replicate it as reliably as possible, especially in the digital era. If we take a photo of a beautiful bouquet of lilies (like the one on my desk) and then display it on a screen, we expect to see the same colors in both the image and reality. However, “reality” here is a misleading term since, once again, the <em>reality</em> of color depends on the viewer. To solve this, we need to understand how light wavelengths (something measurable and replicable) create different color responses in viewers (something not so measurable).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, this task was already carried out 95 years ago by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE, by its French name). I wish I could get into the details of the experiment, but we haven’t gotten into our first color thingie yet. What’s important is that from these measurements, the CIE was able to map all the colors visible to the average human (in the experiment) to light wavelengths and describe them with only three values.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p id=\"footnote-2\">Initially, those three primary values corresponded to the red, green, and blue wavelengths used in the experiment, and they made up the CIERGB <em>Color Space</em>, but researchers noticed that some colors required a negative wavelength<sup><a href=\"#note-2\" data-type=\"internal\" data-id=\"#note-2\">2</a></sup> to represent a visible color. To avoid that, a series of transformations were performed on the original CIERGB and the resulting color space was called CIEXYZ.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This new color space also has three values, X and Z represent the chromaticity of a color, while Y represents its luminance. Since it has three axes, it makes a 3D shape, but if we slice it such that its luminance is the same, we get all the visible colors for a given luminance in a figure you have probably seen before.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"742\" height=\"789\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png?resize=742%2C789&ssl=1\" alt=\"xy chromaticitydiagram showing all visible colors \" class=\"wp-image-386928\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png?w=742&ssl=1 742w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png?resize=282%2C300&ssl=1 282w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is called the <em>xy chromaticity</em> diagram and holds <em>all</em> the colors visible by the average human eye (based on the average viewer in the CIE 1931 experiment). Colors inside the shape are considered real, while those outside are deemed imaginary.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-spaces\">Color Spaces</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of the last explanation was to reach the CIEXYZ Color Space concept, but what exactly is a “color space”? And why is the CIEXYZ <em>Color Space</em> so important?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The CIEXYZ Color Space is a mapping from all the colors visible by the average human eye into a 3D coordinate system, so we only need three values to define a color. Then, a <strong>color space can be thought of as a general mapping of color</strong>, with no need to include every visible color, and it is usually defined through three values as well.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rgb-color-spaces\">RGB Color Spaces</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The most well-known color spaces are the RGB color spaces (note the plural). As you may guess from the name, here we only need the amount of red, green, and blue to describe a color. And to describe an RGB color space, we only need to define its “reddest”, “greenest”, and “bluest” values<sup id=\"footnote-3\"><a href=\"#note-3\">3</a></sup>. If we use coordinates going from 0 to 1 to define a color in the RGB color space, then:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>(1, 0, 0)</code> means the reddest color.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>(0, 1, 0)</code> means the greenest color.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>(0, 0, 1)</code> means the bluest color.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>However, “reddest”, “bluest”, and “greenest” are only arbitrary descriptions of color. What makes a color the “bluest” is up to each person. For example, which of the following colors do you think is the bluest?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1-1024x1024.png?resize=1024%2C1024&ssl=1\" alt=\"Different shades of blue\" class=\"wp-image-386929\" style=\"object-fit:cover;width:300px;height:300px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=1024%2C1024&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=300%2C300&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=768%2C768&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?w=1200&ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As you can guess, something like “bluest” is an appalling description. Luckily, we just have to look back at the CIEXYZ color space — it’s pretty useful! Here, we can define what we consider the reddest, greenest, and bluest colors just as coordinates inside the xy chromaticity diagram. That’s all it takes to create an RGB color space, and why there are so many!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"583\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png?resize=768%2C583&ssl=1\" alt=\"sRGV and WideGamutRGB in the xy chromaticity diagram\" class=\"wp-image-386930\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png?w=768&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png?resize=300%2C228&ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: <a href=\"https://ninedegreesbelow.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">Elle Stone</a></figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In CSS, the most used color space is the standard RGB (sRGB) color space, which, as you can see in the last image, leaves a lot of colors out. However, in CSS, we can use modern RGB color spaces with a lot more colors through the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/c/color/\"><code>color()</code></a> function, such as <code>display-p3</code>, <code>prophoto-rgb</code>, and <code>rec2020</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1473\" height=\"1194\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=1473%2C1194&ssl=1\" alt=\"Comparing the shapes of various color spaces, including sRGB, Display P3, A98-RGB, Rec2020, and ProPhoto.\" class=\"wp-image-386931\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?w=1473&ssl=1 1473w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=300%2C243&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=1024%2C830&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=768%2C623&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Chrome Developer Team</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\">Notice how the ProPhoto RGB color space goes out of the visible color. This is okay. Colors outside are clamped; they aren’t new or invisible colors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In CSS, besides sRGB, we have two more color spaces: the CIELAB color space and the Oklab color space. Luckily, once we understood what the CIEXYZ color space is, then these two should be simpler to understand. Let’s dig into that next.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cielab-and-oklab-color-spaces\">CIELAB and Oklab Color Spaces</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As we saw before, the sRGB color space lacks many of the colors visible by the average human eye. And as modern screens got better at displaying more colors, CSS needed to adopt newer color spaces to fully take advantage of those newer displays. That wasn’t the only problem with sRGB — it also lacks perceptual uniformity, meaning that changes in the color’s chromaticity also change its perceived lightness. Check, for example, this <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/high-definition-css-color-guide#overview\" rel=\"noopener\">demo by Adam Argyle</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_poZgXxy\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/poZgXxy?height=950&theme-id=1&slug-hash=poZgXxy&default-tab=result\" height=\"950\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed poZgXxy\" title=\"CodePen Embed poZgXxy\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Created in 1976 by the CIE, CIELAB, derived from CIEXYZ, also encompasses all the colors visible by the human eye. It works with three coordinates: L for perceptual lightness, a for the amount of red-green, and b* for the amount of yellow-blue in the color.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"726\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lab-color-space.jpg?resize=726%2C450&ssl=1\" alt=\"A diagram in the shape of a sphere containing a range of colors that go from white to black vertically and green to blue to yellow to red horizontally.\" class=\"wp-image-386933\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lab-color-space.jpg?w=726&ssl=1 726w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lab-color-space.jpg?resize=300%2C186&ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Linshang Technology</figcaption></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It has a way better perceptual uniformity than sRGB, but it still isn’t completely uniform, especially in gradients involving blue. For example, in the following white-to-blue gradient, CIELAB shifts towards purple.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"592\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png?resize=592%2C192&ssl=1\" alt=\"Comparing blue gradients in Oklahoma and CIELAB.

Oklab also uses the three <code>L*a*b*</code> coordinates. Thanks to all these improvements, it is the color space I try to use the most lately.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-models\">Color Models</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When I was learning about these concepts, my biggest challenge after understanding color spaces was not getting them confused with color models and color gamuts. These two concepts, while complementary and closely related to color spaces, aren’t the same, so they are a common pitfall when learning about color.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A <strong><dfn>color model</dfn></strong> refers to the mathematical description of color through tuples of numbers, usually involving three numbers, but these values don’t give us an exact color until we pair them with a color space. For example, you know that in the RGB color model, we define color through three values: red, green, and blue. However, it isn’t until we match it to an RGB color space (e.g., sRGB with display-p3) that we have a color. In this sense, a color space can have several color models, like sRGB, which uses RGB, HSL, and HWB. At the same time, a color model can be used in several color spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I found plenty of articles and tutorials where “color spaces” and “color models” were used interchangeably. And some places were they had a different definition of color spaces and models than the one provided here. For example, Chrome’s <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/high-definition-css-color-guide#what_is_a_color_space\" rel=\"noopener\">High definition CSS color guide</a> defines CSS’s RGB and HSL as different color spaces, while MDN’s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_space#rgb_color_spaces\" rel=\"noopener\">Color Space entry</a> does define RGB and HSL as part of the sRGB color space.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Personally, in CSS, I find it easier to understand the idea of RGB, HSL and HWB as different models to access the sRGB color space.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-gamuts\">Color Gamuts</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A <strong><dfn>color gamut</dfn></strong> is more straightforward to explain. You may have noticed how we have talked about a color space having more colors than another, but it would be more correct to say it has a “wider” gamut, since a color gamut is the range of colors available in a color space. However, a color gamut isn’t only restricted by color space boundaries, but also by physical limitations. For example, an older screen may decrease the color gamut since it isn’t able to display each color available in a given color space. In this case where a color can’t be represented (due to physical limitation or being outside the color space itself), it’s said to be “out of gamut”.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-functions\">Color Functions</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In CSS, the only color space available used to be sRGB. Nowadays, we can work with a lot of modern color spaces through their respective color functions. As a quick reference, each of the color spaces in CSS uses the following functions:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>sRGB:</strong> We can work in sRGB using the ol’ hexadecimal notation, named colors, and the <code>rgb()</code>, <code>rgba()</code>, <code>hsl()</code>, <code>hsla()</code> and <code>hwb()</code> functions.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>CIELAB:</strong> Here we have the <code>lab()</code> for Cartesian coordinates and <code>lch()</code> for polar coordinates.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Oklab:</strong> Similar to CIELAB, we have <code>oklab()</code> for Cartesian coordinates and <code>oklch()</code> for polar coordinates.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>More through the <code>color()</code> and <code>color-mix()</code>.</strong> Outside these three color spaces, we can use many more using the <code>color()</code> and <code>color-mix()</code> functions. Specifically, we can use the RGB color spaces: <code>rgb-linear</code>, <code>display-p3</code>, <code>a98-rgb</code>, <code>prophoto-rgb</code>, <code>rec2020</code> and the XYZ color space: <code>xyz</code>, <code>xyz-d50</code>, or <code>xyz-d65</code>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tl-dr\">TL;DR</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Color spaces</strong> are a mapping between available colors and a coordinate system. In CSS, we have three main color spaces: sRGB, CIELAB, and Oklab, but many more are accessible through the <code>color()</code> function.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Color models</strong> define color with tuples of numbers, but they don’t give us information about the actual color until we pair them with a color space. For example, the RGB model doesn’t mean anything until we assign it an RGB color space.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Most of the time, we want to talk about how many colors a color space holds, so we use the term <strong>color gamut</strong> for the task. However, a color gamut is also tied to the physical limitations of a camera/display. A color may be out-of-gamut, meaning it can’t be represented in a given color space.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>In CSS, <strong>we can access all these color spaces through color functions</strong>, of which there are many.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The <strong>CIEXYZ color space</strong> is extremely useful to define other color spaces, describe their gamuts, and convert between them.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"references\">References</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/xyz-rgb.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Completely Painless Programmer’s Guide to XYZ, RGB, ICC, xyY, and TRCs</a> (Elle Stone)</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/color-spaces/\" rel=\"noopener\">Color Spaces</a> (Bartosz Ciechanowski)</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"http://dougkerr.net/Pumpkin/articles/CIE_XYZ.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">The CIE XYZ and xyY Color Spaces</a>(Douglas A.

JavaScript의 새로운 기능인 명시적 리소스 관리(Explicit Resource Management)에 대해 다룹니다. 파일 핸들, 네트워크 연결, 스트림 등의 리소스를 다룰 때 개발자들이 흔히 겪는 메모리 누수와 리소스 정리 문제를 해결하기 위해 도입된 이 기능은 <code>using</code>과 <code>await using</code> 선언문을 통해 리소스의 생명주기를 자동으로 관리합니다.</p><p>기존에는 <code>try...finally</code> 블록을 사용해 수동으로 리소스를 정리해야 했지만, 이제는 스코프가 종료될 때 자동으로 정리 작업이 수행되어 개발자의 실수를 줄이고 코드의 안정성을 높입니다. 특히 <code>ReadableStreamDefaultReader</code>와 같은 웹 API를 사용할 때 발생하는 잠금 해제 누락 문제를 효과적으로 방지할 수 있습니다.</p><p>자바스크립트가 더욱 견고한 리소스 관리 체계를 갖추어 나가는 이 시점에서, 새로운 패턴을 활용해 더 안전하고 효율적인 코드를 작성하는 방법을 살펴볼 수 있는 글입니다.

    "content": "<p>How do you keep up with new CSS features?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s say for example that, hypothetically speaking, you run a popular web development survey focused on CSS, and need to figure out what to include in this year’s edition. (In a <em>total</em> coincidence the aforementioned State of CSS survey for this year is actually open right now — <a href=\"https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-css/2025?source=css_tricks_keeping_up\" rel=\"noopener\">go take it to see what’s new in CSS!</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You might think you can just type “new CSS features 2025” in Google and be done with it. But while this does give us a few promising leads, it also unearths a lot of cookie-cutter content that proclaims CSS Grid as the “next big thing”, despite the fact it’s been well-supported for over eight years now. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We need a better approach. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>I’ll focus on CSS in this article, but all the resources linked here cover all web platform features, including JavaScript and HTML.</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387159\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"browser-blogs\"><a href=\"https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-to-keep-up-with-the-web-platform-506n-temp-slug-493011?preview=619f23b56568208f51ce715d46320d1ef2b4b3cdc621099b35734c635b8a9e7857bd509490d9985c09f950ad096b5e5305b236f1b3437f820b997071#webdev\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>Browser blogs</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"521\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/https-dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com-uploads-articles-h0r4b6x6qdqkfbivw6w5.png.webp?resize=800%2C521&ssl=1\" alt=\"New to the web platform in April\" class=\"wp-image-387165\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/https-dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com-uploads-articles-h0r4b6x6qdqkfbivw6w5.png.webp?w=800&ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/https-dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com-uploads-articles-h0r4b6x6qdqkfbivw6w5.png.webp?resize=300%2C195&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/https-dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com-uploads-articles-h0r4b6x6qdqkfbivw6w5.png.webp?resize=768%2C500&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The browsers themselves are often a good source of what’s new and, thankfully, the big ones maintain blogs where they even cover specific CSS news.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A good general starting point is Google’s <a href=\"https://web.dev/blog?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web.dev</a> blog, and more specifically <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/rachelandrew.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rachel Andrew</a>‘s monthly web platform recaps. Here’s a small sample of those:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-01-2025?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New to the web platform in January</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-02-2025?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New to the web platform in February</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-03-2025?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New to the web platform in March</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-04-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New to the web platform in April</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The WebKit blog is, of course, another great place. <a href=\"https://jensimmons.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Jen Simmons</a> is very active on the blog (as well as <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jensimmons.bsky.social\" rel=\"noopener\">Bluesky</a>) and <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/category/css/\" rel=\"noopener\">there’s an entire category dedicated solely to CSS</a>.

But you probably already know that since you’re reading this.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And let’s not discount other fine publications that cover CSS.

This one features more fine-grained filtering tools, letting you narrow down features by <a href=\"https://webstatus.dev/?q=baseline_date%3A2025-01-01..2025-12-31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">features mentioned as Top CSS Interop in the latest State of CSS survey</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another very cool feature is the ability to view a feature’s adoption rate, as measured in terms of percentage of Chrome page views where that feature was used, such as here for the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/poppin-in/\">popover</a></code> HTML attribute:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\"

skewed once one of these platforms adopts a new feature.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Web Platform Status’s <a href=\"https://webstatus.dev/stats\" rel=\"noopener\">stats</a> section also features the “chart of shame” (according to <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/lea.verou.me/post/3lqdkh5cexc2y\" rel=\"noopener\">Lea Verou</a>), which highlights how certain browsers might be slightly lagging behind their peers in terms of new feature adoption.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chrome-platform-status\"><a

You should definitely be following him, but statistically speaking you probably already are! It’s also worth mentioning that <a href=\"https://html-css-tip-of-the-week.netlify.app\" rel=\"noopener\">Kevin runs a site that publishes weekly HTML and CSS tips</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"css-working-group\"><a href=\"https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-to-keep-up-with-the-web-platform-506n-temp-slug-493011?preview=619f23b56568208f51ce715d46320d1ef2b4b3cdc621099b35734c635b8a9e7857bd509490d9985c09f950ad096b5e5305b236f1b3437f820b997071#css-working-group\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>CSS Working Group</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, you can always also go straight to the source and look at what the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/css/publications/#wd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CSS Working Group itself</a> has been working on! They have <a href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/\" rel=\"noopener\">a mailing list</a> you can subscribe to keep tabs on things straight from your inbox, as well as an <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/css/feed/\" rel=\"noopener\">RSS feed</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"browser-release-notes\">Browser release notes</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Most browsers publish a set of release notes any time a new version ships. For the most part, you can get a good pulse on when new CSS features are released by following the three big names in browsers:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrome release notes</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes\" rel=\"noopener\">Safari release notes</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases/\" rel=\"noopener\">Firefox release notes</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chatgpt\">ChatGPT</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to catch up with CSS is to just ask <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ChatGPT</a>! This sample prompt worked well enough for me:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>What are the latest CSS features that have either become supported by browsers in the past year, or will soon become supported? </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-resources\"><a href=\"https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-to-keep-up-with-the-web-platform-506n-temp-slug-493011?preview=619f23b56568208f51ce715d46320d1ef2b4b3cdc621099b35734c635b8a9e7857bd509490d9985c09f950ad096b5e5305b236f1b3437f820b997071#other-resources\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>Other resources</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you really want to get in the weeds, Igalia’s <a href=\"https://bcd-watch.igalia.com\" rel=\"noopener\">BCD Watch</a> displays changes to MDN’s <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">browser-compat-data repo</a>, which itself tracks which features are supported in which browsers. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the latest editions of the HTTP Archive Web Almanac do not seem to include a CSS section specifically, but <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/css\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">past editions did feature one</a>, which was a great way to catch up with CSS once a year. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There’s also <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">caniuse</a> has a <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/ciu/news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">news section</a> which does not seem to be frequently updated at the moment, but could potentially become a great resource for up-to-date new feature info in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/autonome/intenttoship-bot?tab=readme-ov-file\" rel=\"noopener\">IntentToShip bot</a> (available on <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/intenttoship.dev\" rel=\"noopener\">Bluesky</a>, <a href=\"https://fed.brid.gy/bsky/intenttoship.dev\" rel=\"noopener\">Mastodon</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/intenttoship/\">Twitter</a>) posts whenever a browser vendor ships or changes a feature. You can’t get more cutting-edge than that!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And lastly, there’s a ton of folks on social media who are frequently discussing new CSS features and sharing their own thoughts and experiments with them. If you’re on Bluesky, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/starter-pack/css-tricks.com/3la2jvt37sh2s\">there’s a starter pack of CSS-Tricks authors</a> that’s a good spot to find a deep community of people.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, another great way to make sure no new features are slipping through the cracks is to take the State of CSS survey once a year. I use all the resources mentioned above to try and make sure each survey includes every new important feature. What’s more, you can bookmark features by adding them to your “reading list” as you take the survey to get a nice recap at the end.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So go take this year’s <a href=\"https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-css/2025?source=css_tricks_keeping_up\" rel=\"noopener\">State of CSS</a> survey and then let me know on <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sachagreif.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Bluesky</a> how many new features you learned about!</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/how-to-keep-up-with-new-css-features/\">How to Keep Up With New CSS Features</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=css-tricks.com&utm_campaign=family_&utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

(In a <em>total</em> coincidence the aforementioned State of CSS survey for this year is actually open right now — <a href=\"https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-css/2025?source=css_tricks_keeping_up\" rel=\"noopener\">go take it to see what’s new in CSS!</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>You might think you can just type “new CSS features 2025” in Google and be done with it. But while this does give us a few promising leads, it also unearths a lot of cookie-cutter content that proclaims CSS Grid as the “next big thing”, despite the fact it’s been well-supported for over eight years now. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We need a better approach. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>I’ll focus on CSS in this article, but all the resources linked here cover all web platform features, including JavaScript and HTML.</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-387159\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"browser-blogs\"><a href=\"https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-to-keep-up-with-the-web-platform-506n-temp-slug-493011?preview=619f23b56568208f51ce715d46320d1ef2b4b3cdc621099b35734c635b8a9e7857bd509490d9985c09f950ad096b5e5305b236f1b3437f820b997071#webdev\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>Browser blogs</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"800\" height=\"521\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/https-dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com-uploads-articles-h0r4b6x6qdqkfbivw6w5.png.webp?resize=800%2C521&ssl=1\" alt=\"New to the web platform in April\" class=\"wp-image-387165\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/https-dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com-uploads-articles-h0r4b6x6qdqkfbivw6w5.png.webp?w=800&ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/https-dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com-uploads-articles-h0r4b6x6qdqkfbivw6w5.png.webp?resize=300%2C195&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/https-dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com-uploads-articles-h0r4b6x6qdqkfbivw6w5.png.webp?resize=768%2C500&ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (min-width: 735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The browsers themselves are often a good source of what’s new and, thankfully, the big ones maintain blogs where they even cover specific CSS news.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A good general starting point is Google’s <a href=\"https://web.dev/blog?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web.dev</a> blog, and more specifically <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/rachelandrew.bsky.social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rachel Andrew</a>‘s monthly web platform recaps. Here’s a small sample of those:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-01-2025?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New to the web platform in January</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-02-2025?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New to the web platform in February</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-03-2025?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New to the web platform in March</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://web.dev/blog/web-platform-04-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">New to the web platform in April</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The WebKit blog is, of course, another great place. <a href=\"https://jensimmons.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Jen Simmons</a> is very active on the blog (as well as <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jensimmons.bsky.social\" rel=\"noopener\">Bluesky</a>) and <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/category/css/\" rel=\"noopener\">there’s an entire category dedicated solely to CSS</a>. The blog doesn’t publish content as regularly as web.dev, but the breadth of content is incredibly deep and thorough, as you can see in <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/16547/better-typography-with-text-wrap-pretty/\" rel=\"noopener\">Jen’s write-up on the release of <code>text-wrap: pretty</code></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And, to round things out, you’ll want to keep an eye on <a href=\"https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org\" rel=\"noopener\">Firefox Nightly News</a> for what’s shipping in Firefox, and t<a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/\" rel=\"noopener\">he official blog for Microsoft Edge</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"csstricks-and-others\"><a href=\"https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-to-keep-up-with-the-web-platform-506n-temp-slug-493011?preview=619f23b56568208f51ce715d46320d1ef2b4b3cdc621099b35734c635b8a9e7857bd509490d9985c09f950ad096b5e5305b236f1b3437f820b997071#csstricks\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>CSS-Tricks (and others)</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I’d be remiss to not mention that <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CSS-Tricks</a> is also a great source for up-to-date CSS knowledge, including an ever-growing <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/\">almanac of CSS features</a>. But you probably already know that since you’re reading this.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And let’s not discount other fine publications that cover CSS. Here are just a few:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/css/\" rel=\"noopener\">Smashing Magazine</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/blog/\" rel=\"noopener\">Frontend Masters Blog</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://piccalil.li\" rel=\"noopener\">Piccalilli</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tip.com\" rel=\"noopener\">CSS-Tip</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Following individual sources can get a little overwhelming, particularly when CSS is moving as fast as it is.

This one features more fine-grained filtering tools, letting you narrow down features by <a href=\"https://webstatus.dev/?q=baseline_date%3A2025-01-01..2025-12-31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">features mentioned as Top CSS Interop in the latest State of CSS survey</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another very cool feature is the ability to view a feature’s adoption rate, as measured in terms of percentage of Chrome page views where that feature was used, such as here for the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/poppin-in/\">popover</a></code> HTML attribute:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\"

735px) 864px, 96vw\" /></figure>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>An important caveat: since sites like Facebook and Google account for a very large percentage of all measured page views, this metric can become skewed once one of these platforms adopts a new feature.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The Web Platform Status’s <a href=\"https://webstatus.dev/stats\" rel=\"noopener\">stats</a> section also features the “chart of shame” (according to <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/lea.verou.me/post/3lqdkh5cexc2y\" rel=\"noopener\">Lea Verou</a>), which highlights how certain browsers might be slightly lagging behind their peers in terms of new feature adoption.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chrome-platform-status\"><a

For the most part, you can get a good pulse on when new CSS features are released by following the three big names in browsers:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes\" rel=\"noopener\">Chrome release notes</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-release-notes\" rel=\"noopener\">Safari release notes</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/releases/\" rel=\"noopener\">Firefox release notes</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"chatgpt\">ChatGPT</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to catch up with CSS is to just ask <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ChatGPT</a>! This sample prompt worked well enough for me:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p>What are the latest CSS features that have either become supported by browsers in the past year, or will soon become supported? </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"other-resources\"><a href=\"https://dev.to/sachagreif/how-to-keep-up-with-the-web-platform-506n-temp-slug-493011?preview=619f23b56568208f51ce715d46320d1ef2b4b3cdc621099b35734c635b8a9e7857bd509490d9985c09f950ad096b5e5305b236f1b3437f820b997071#other-resources\" rel=\"noopener\"></a>Other resources</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If you really want to get in the weeds, Igalia’s <a href=\"https://bcd-watch.igalia.com\" rel=\"noopener\">BCD Watch</a> displays changes to MDN’s <a href=\"https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">browser-compat-data repo</a>, which itself tracks which features are supported in which browsers. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the latest editions of the HTTP Archive Web Almanac do not seem to include a CSS section specifically, but <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/css\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">past editions did feature one</a>, which was a great way to catch up with CSS once a year. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There’s also <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">caniuse</a> has a <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/ciu/news\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">news section</a> which does not seem to be frequently updated at the moment, but could potentially become a great resource for up-to-date new feature info in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/autonome/intenttoship-bot?tab=readme-ov-file\" rel=\"noopener\">IntentToShip bot</a> (available on <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/intenttoship.dev\" rel=\"noopener\">Bluesky</a>, <a href=\"https://fed.brid.gy/bsky/intenttoship.dev\" rel=\"noopener\">Mastodon</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/intenttoship/\">Twitter</a>) posts whenever a browser vendor ships or changes a feature. You can’t get more cutting-edge than that!</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And lastly, there’s a ton of folks on social media who are frequently discussing new CSS features and sharing their own thoughts and experiments with them. If you’re on Bluesky, <a href=\"https://bsky.app/starter-pack/css-tricks.com/3la2jvt37sh2s\">there’s a starter pack of CSS-Tricks authors</a> that’s a good spot to find a deep community of people.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, another great way to make sure no new features are slipping through the cracks is to take the State of CSS survey once a year. I use all the resources mentioned above to try and make sure each survey includes every new important feature. What’s more, you can bookmark features by adding them to your “reading list” as you take the survey to get a nice recap at the end.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So go take this year’s <a href=\"https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-css/2025?source=css_tricks_keeping_up\" rel=\"noopener\">State of CSS</a> survey and then let me know on <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sachagreif.com\" rel=\"noopener\">Bluesky</a> how many new features you learned about!</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/how-to-keep-up-with-new-css-features/\">How to Keep Up With New CSS Features</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=css-tricks.com&utm_campaign=family_&utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

    "title": "A Better API for the Resize Observer",
    "content": "<p>Resize Observer, Mutation Observer, and Intersection Observers are all good APIs that are more performant than their older counterparts:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>ResizeObserver</code> is <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/resize-observer\" rel=\"noopener\">better</a> than the <code>resize</code> event</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>MutationObserver</code> replaces the now deprecated <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationEvent\" rel=\"noopener\">Mutation Events</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>IntersectionObserver</code> lets you do certain <code>scroll</code> interactions with <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/dynamic-header-intersection-observer/\" rel=\"noopener\">less performance overhead</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The API for these three observers are quite similar (but they have their differences which we will go into later). To use an observer, you have to follow the steps below:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-386338\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Create a new observer with the <code>new</code> keyword:</strong> This observer takes in an observer function to execute.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Do something with the observed changes</strong>: This is done via the observer function that is passed into the observer.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Observe a specific element</strong>: By using the <code>observe</code> method.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>(Optionally) unobserve the element</strong>: By using the <code>unobserve</code> or <code>disconnect</code> method. (depending on which observer you’re using).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In practice, the above steps looks like this with the <code>ResizeObserver</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Step 1: Create a new observer\r\nconst observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n// Step 2: Do something with the observed changes\r\nfunction observerFn (entries) {\r\n  for (let entry of entries) {\r\n    // Do something with entry\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Step 3: Observe an element\r\nconst element = document.querySelector('#some-element')\r\nobserver.observe(element);\r\n\r\n// Step 4 (optional): Disconnect the observer\r\nobserver.disconnect(element)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This looks clear (and understandable) after the steps have been made clear. But it can look like a mess without the comments:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\nfunction observerFn (entries) {\r\n  for (let entry of entries) {\r\n    // Do something with entry\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst element = document.querySelector('#some-element')\r\nobserver.observe(element);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is: I think we can improve the observer APIs and make them easier to use.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-resize-observer\">The Resize Observer</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s start with the <code><a href=\"https://splendidlabz.com/docs/utils/dom/resize-observer\" rel=\"noopener\">ResizeObserver</a></code> since it’s the simplest of them all. We’ll begin by writing a function that encapsulates the <code>resizeObserver</code> that we create.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver () {\r\n  // ... Do something\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The easiest way to begin refactoring the <code>ResizeObserver</code> code is to put everything we’ve created into our <code>resizeObserver</code> first.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver () {\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n      // Do something with entry\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const node = document.querySelector('#some-element')\r\n  observer.observe(node);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we can pass the <code>element</code> into the function to make it simpler. When we do this, we can eliminate the <code>document.querySelector</code> line.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (element) {\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n      // Do something with entry\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  observer.observe(node);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This makes the function more versatile since we can now pass any element into it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Usage of the resizeObserver function\r\nconst node = document.querySelector('#some-element')\r\nconst obs = resizeObserver(node)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is already much easier than writing all of the <code>ResizeObserver</code> code from scratch whenever you wish to use it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next, it’s quite obvious that we have to pass in an observer function to the callback. So, we can potentially do this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Not great\r\nfunction resizeObserver (node, observerFn) {\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n  observer.observe(node);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since <code>observerFn</code> is always the same — it loops through the <code>entries</code> and acts on every <code>entry</code> — we could keep the <code>observerFn</code> and pass in a <code>callback</code> to perform tasks when the element is resized.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Better \r\nfunction resizeObserver (node, callback) {\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n      callback(entry)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  observer.observe(node);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To use this, we can pass <code>callback</code> into the <code>resizeObserver</code> — this makes <code>resizeObserver</code> operate somewhat like an event listener which we are already familiar with.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Usage of the resizeObserver function\r\nconst node = document.querySelector('#some-element')\r\nconst obs = resizeObserver(node, entry => {\r\n  // Do something with each entry\r\n})</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can make the callback slightly better by providing both <code>entry</code> and <code>entries</code>. There’s no performance hit for passing an additional variable so there’s no harm providing more flexibility here.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"6\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (element, callback) {\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n      callback({ entry, entries })\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  observer.observe(element);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Then we can grab <code>entries</code> in the <code>callback</code> if we need to.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Usage of the resizeObserver function\r\n// ...\r\nconst obs = resizeObserver(node, ({ entry, entries }) => {\r\n  // ...\r\n})</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next, it makes sense to pass the callback as an option parameter instead of a variable. This will make <code>resizeObserver</code> more consistent with the <code><a href=\"https://splendidlabz.com/docs/utils/dom/mutation-observer\" rel=\"noopener\">mutationObserver</a></code> and <code><a href=\"https://splendidlabz.com/docs/utils/dom/intersection-observer\" rel=\"noopener\">intersectionObserver</a></code> functions that we will create in the next article.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"1,2\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (element, options = {}) {\r\n  const { callback } = options\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n        callback({ entry, entries })\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  observer.observe(element);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Then we can use <code>resizeObserver</code> like this.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const obs = resizeObserver(node, {\r\n  callback ({ entry, entries }) {\r\n    // Do something ...\r\n  }\r\n})</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-observer-can-take-in-an-option-too\">The observer can take in an option too</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><code>ResizeObserver</code>‘s <code>observe</code> method can take in an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver/observe#options\" rel=\"noopener\">options</a> object that contains one property, <code>box</code>. This determines whether the observer will observe changes to <code>content-box</code>, <code>border-box</code> or <code>device-pixel-content-box</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, we need to extract these options from the <code>options</code> object and pass them to <code>observe</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (element, options = {}) {\r\n  const { callback, ...opts } = options\r\n  // ...\r\n  observer.observe(element, opts);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"optional-event-listener-pattern\">Optional: Event listener pattern</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I prefer using <code>callback</code> because it’s quite straightforward. But if you want to use a standard event listener pattern, we can do that, too. The trick here is to emit an event. We’ll call it <code>resize-obs</code> since <code>resize</code> is already taken.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (element, options = {}) {\r\n  // ...\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n      if (callback) callback({ entry, entries })\r\n      else {\r\n        node.dispatchEvent(\r\n          new CustomEvent('resize-obs', {\r\n            detail: { entry, entries },\r\n          }),\r\n        )\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Then we can listen to the <code>resize-obs</code> event, like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const obs = resizeObserver(node)\r\nnode.addEventListener('resize-obs', event => {\r\n  const { entry, entries } = event.detail\r\n})</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Again, this is optional.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"unobserving-the-element\">Unobserving the element</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One final step is to allow the user to stop observing the element(s) when observation is no longer required. To do this, we can return two of the <code>observer</code> methods:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>unobserve</code>: Stops observing one <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>Element</code></a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>disconnect</code>: Stops observing all <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>Elements</code></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (node, options = {}) {\r\n  // ...\r\n  return {\r\n    unobserve(node) {\r\n      observer.unobserve(node)\r\n    },\r\n    \r\n    disconnect() {\r\n      observer.disconnet()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Both methods do the same thing for what we have built so far since we only allowed <code>resizeObserver</code> to observe one element.

    "content": "<p>Resize Observer, Mutation Observer, and Intersection Observers are all good APIs that are more performant than their older counterparts:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>ResizeObserver</code> is <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/resize-observer\" rel=\"noopener\">better</a> than the <code>resize</code> event</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>MutationObserver</code> replaces the now deprecated <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationEvent\" rel=\"noopener\">Mutation Events</a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>IntersectionObserver</code> lets you do certain <code>scroll</code> interactions with <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/dynamic-header-intersection-observer/\" rel=\"noopener\">less performance overhead</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The API for these three observers are quite similar (but they have their differences which we will go into later). To use an observer, you have to follow the steps below:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-386338\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><strong>Create a new observer with the <code>new</code> keyword:</strong> This observer takes in an observer function to execute.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Do something with the observed changes</strong>: This is done via the observer function that is passed into the observer.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>Observe a specific element</strong>: By using the <code>observe</code> method.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><strong>(Optionally) unobserve the element</strong>: By using the <code>unobserve</code> or <code>disconnect</code> method. (depending on which observer you’re using).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In practice, the above steps looks like this with the <code>ResizeObserver</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Step 1: Create a new observer\r\nconst observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n// Step 2: Do something with the observed changes\r\nfunction observerFn (entries) {\r\n  for (let entry of entries) {\r\n    // Do something with entry\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Step 3: Observe an element\r\nconst element = document.querySelector('#some-element')\r\nobserver.observe(element);\r\n\r\n// Step 4 (optional): Disconnect the observer\r\nobserver.disconnect(element)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This looks clear (and understandable) after the steps have been made clear. But it can look like a mess without the comments:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\nfunction observerFn (entries) {\r\n  for (let entry of entries) {\r\n    // Do something with entry\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst element = document.querySelector('#some-element')\r\nobserver.observe(element);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is: I think we can improve the observer APIs and make them easier to use.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-resize-observer\">The Resize Observer</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s start with the <code><a href=\"https://splendidlabz.com/docs/utils/dom/resize-observer\" rel=\"noopener\">ResizeObserver</a></code> since it’s the simplest of them all. We’ll begin by writing a function that encapsulates the <code>resizeObserver</code> that we create.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver () {\r\n  // ... Do something\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The easiest way to begin refactoring the <code>ResizeObserver</code> code is to put everything we’ve created into our <code>resizeObserver</code> first.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver () {\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n      // Do something with entry\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const node = document.querySelector('#some-element')\r\n  observer.observe(node);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we can pass the <code>element</code> into the function to make it simpler. When we do this, we can eliminate the <code>document.querySelector</code> line.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (element) {\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n      // Do something with entry\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  observer.observe(node);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This makes the function more versatile since we can now pass any element into it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Usage of the resizeObserver function\r\nconst node = document.querySelector('#some-element')\r\nconst obs = resizeObserver(node)</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is already much easier than writing all of the <code>ResizeObserver</code> code from scratch whenever you wish to use it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next, it’s quite obvious that we have to pass in an observer function to the callback. So, we can potentially do this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Not great\r\nfunction resizeObserver (node, observerFn) {\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n  observer.observe(node);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Since <code>observerFn</code> is always the same — it loops through the <code>entries</code> and acts on every <code>entry</code> — we could keep the <code>observerFn</code> and pass in a <code>callback</code> to perform tasks when the element is resized.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Better \r\nfunction resizeObserver (node, callback) {\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n      callback(entry)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  observer.observe(node);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To use this, we can pass <code>callback</code> into the <code>resizeObserver</code> — this makes <code>resizeObserver</code> operate somewhat like an event listener which we are already familiar with.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Usage of the resizeObserver function\r\nconst node = document.querySelector('#some-element')\r\nconst obs = resizeObserver(node, entry => {\r\n  // Do something with each entry\r\n})</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can make the callback slightly better by providing both <code>entry</code> and <code>entries</code>. There’s no performance hit for passing an additional variable so there’s no harm providing more flexibility here.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"6\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (element, callback) {\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n      callback({ entry, entries })\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  observer.observe(element);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Then we can grab <code>entries</code> in the <code>callback</code> if we need to.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">// Usage of the resizeObserver function\r\n// ...\r\nconst obs = resizeObserver(node, ({ entry, entries }) => {\r\n  // ...\r\n})</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next, it makes sense to pass the callback as an option parameter instead of a variable. This will make <code>resizeObserver</code> more consistent with the <code><a href=\"https://splendidlabz.com/docs/utils/dom/mutation-observer\" rel=\"noopener\">mutationObserver</a></code> and <code><a href=\"https://splendidlabz.com/docs/utils/dom/intersection-observer\" rel=\"noopener\">intersectionObserver</a></code> functions that we will create in the next article.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"1,2\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (element, options = {}) {\r\n  const { callback } = options\r\n  const observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\r\n\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n        callback({ entry, entries })\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  observer.observe(element);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Then we can use <code>resizeObserver</code> like this.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const obs = resizeObserver(node, {\r\n  callback ({ entry, entries }) {\r\n    // Do something ...\r\n  }\r\n})</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-observer-can-take-in-an-option-too\">The observer can take in an option too</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><code>ResizeObserver</code>‘s <code>observe</code> method can take in an <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver/observe#options\" rel=\"noopener\">options</a> object that contains one property, <code>box</code>. This determines whether the observer will observe changes to <code>content-box</code>, <code>border-box</code> or <code>device-pixel-content-box</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, we need to extract these options from the <code>options</code> object and pass them to <code>observe</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (element, options = {}) {\r\n  const { callback, ...opts } = options\r\n  // ...\r\n  observer.observe(element, opts);\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"optional-event-listener-pattern\">Optional: Event listener pattern</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I prefer using <code>callback</code> because it’s quite straightforward. But if you want to use a standard event listener pattern, we can do that, too. The trick here is to emit an event. We’ll call it <code>resize-obs</code> since <code>resize</code> is already taken.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (element, options = {}) {\r\n  // ...\r\n  function observerFn (entries) {\r\n    for (let entry of entries) {\r\n      if (callback) callback({ entry, entries })\r\n      else {\r\n        node.dispatchEvent(\r\n          new CustomEvent('resize-obs', {\r\n            detail: { entry, entries },\r\n          }),\r\n        )\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Then we can listen to the <code>resize-obs</code> event, like this:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const obs = resizeObserver(node)\r\nnode.addEventListener('resize-obs', event => {\r\n  const { entry, entries } = event.detail\r\n})</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Again, this is optional.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"unobserving-the-element\">Unobserving the element</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One final step is to allow the user to stop observing the element(s) when observation is no longer required. To do this, we can return two of the <code>observer</code> methods:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li><code>unobserve</code>: Stops observing one <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>Element</code></a></li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><code>disconnect</code>: Stops observing all <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>Elements</code></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">function resizeObserver (node, options = {}) {\r\n  // ...\r\n  return {\r\n    unobserve(node) {\r\n      observer.unobserve(node)\r\n    },\r\n    \r\n    disconnect() {\r\n      observer.disconnet()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Both methods do the same thing for what we have built so far since we only allowed <code>resizeObserver</code> to observe one element.

    "title": "Breaking Boundaries: Building a Tangram Puzzle With (S)CSS",
    "content": "<p>For years, I believed that drag-and-drop games — especially those involving rotation, spatial logic, and puzzle solving — were the exclusive domain of JavaScript. Until one day, I asked AI:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p><em>“Is it possible to build a fully interactive Tangram puzzle game using only CSS?”</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The answer: <em>“No — not really. You’ll need JavaScript.”</em> That was all the motivation I needed to prove otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-386648\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gbOBMqm\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/gbOBMqm?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=gbOBMqm&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gbOBMqm\" title=\"CodePen Embed gbOBMqm\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But first, let’s ask the obvious question: <em>Why would anyone do this?</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Well…</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>To know how far CSS can be pushed in creating interactive UIs.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>To get better at my CSS skills.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>And it’s fun!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fair enough?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, here’s the unsurprising truth: CSS isn’t exactly made for this. It’s not a logic language, and let’s be honest, it’s not particularly dynamic either. (Sure, we have CSS variables and some handy built-in functions now, hooray!)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In JavaScript, we naturally think in terms of functions, loops, conditions, objects, comparisons. We write logic, abstract things into methods, and eventually ship a bundle that the browser understands. And once it’s shipped? We rarely look at that final JavaScript bundle — we just focus on keeping it lean.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now ask yourself: isn’t that exactly what Sass does for CSS?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Why should we hand-write endless lines of repetitive CSS when we can use mixins and functions to generate it — cleanly, efficiently, and without caring how many lines it takes, as long as the output is optimized?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, we put it to the test and it turns out Sass can replace JavaScript, at least when it comes to low-level logic and puzzle behavior. With nothing but maps, mixins, functions, and a whole lot of math, we managed to bring our Tangram puzzle to life, no JavaScript required.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let the (CSS-only) games begin! 🎉</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-game\">The game</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The game consists of seven pieces: the classic Tangram set. Naturally, these pieces can be arranged into a perfect square (and many other shapes, too). But we need a bit more than just static pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So here’s what I am building:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>A puzzle goal, which is the target shape the player has to recreate.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>A start button that shuffles all the pieces into a staging area.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Each piece is clickable and interactive.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The puzzle should let the user know when they get a piece wrong and also celebrate when they finish the puzzle.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-1-html-structure\">The HTML structure</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I started by setting up the HTML structure, which is no small task, considering the number of elements involved.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Each shape was given seven radio buttons. I chose radios over checkboxes to take advantage of their built-in exclusivity. Only one can be selected within the same group. This made it much easier to track which shape and state were currently active.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The start button? Also a radio input. A checkbox could’ve worked too, but for the sake of consistency, I stuck with radios across the board.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The puzzle map itself is just a plain old <code><div></code>, simple and effective.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>For rotation, we added eight radio buttons, each representing a 45-degree increment: 45°, 90°, 135°, all the way to 360°. These simulate rotation controls entirely in CSS.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Every potential shadow position got its own radio button too. (Yes, it’s a lot, I know.)</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>And to wrap it all up, I included a classic reset button inside a <code><form></code> using <code><button type=\"reset\"></code>, so players can easily start over at any point.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Given the sheer number of elements required, I used Pug to generate the HTML more efficiently. It was purely a convenience choice. It doesn’t affect the logic or behavior of the puzzle in any way.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Below is a sample of the compiled HTML. It might look overwhelming at first glance (and this is just a portion of it!), but it illustrates the structural complexity involved. This section is collapsed to not nuke your screen, but it can be expanded if you’d like to explore it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<details >\r\n  <summary>\r\n          Open HTML Code      </summary>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><div class=\"wrapper\">\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <form class=\"container\">\r\n    <input class=\"hide_input start\" type=\"checkbox\" id=\"start\" autofocus />\r\n    <button class=\"start-button\" type=\"reset\" id=\"restart\">Restart</button>\r\n    <label class=\"start-button\" for=\"start\">Start </label>\r\n    <div class=\"shadow\">\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"radio\" id=\"blueTriangle-tan\" name=\"tan-active\" />\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"radio\" id=\"yellowTriangle-tan\" name=\"tan-active\" />\r\n      <!-- Inputs for others tans -->\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"radio\" id=\"rotation-reset\" name=\"tan-active\" />\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"radio\" id=\"rotation-45\" name=\"tan-rotation\" />\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"radio\" id=\"rotation-90\" name=\"tan-rotation\" />\r\n      <!--radios for 90, 225, 315, 360 -->\r\n\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"checkbox\" id=\"yellowTriangle-tan-1-135\" name=\"tan-rotation\" />\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"checkbox\" id=\"yellowTriangle-tan-1-225\" name=\"tan-rotation\" />\r\n      <!-- radio for every possible shape shadows-->\r\n\r\n      <label class=\"rotation rot\" for=\"rotation-45\" id=\"rot45\">⟲</label>\r\n      <label class=\"rotation rot\" for=\"rotation-90\" id=\"rot90\">⟲</label>\r\n      <!--radios for 90, 225, 315, 360 -->\r\n      <label class=\"rotation\" for=\"rotation-reset\" id=\"rotReset\">✘</label>\r\n\r\n      <label class=\"blueTriangle tans\" for=\"blueTriangle-tan\" id=\"tanblueTrianglelab\"></label>\r\n      <div class=\"tans tan_blocked\" id=\"tanblueTrianglelabRes\"></div>\r\n      <!-- labels for every tan and disabled div -->\r\n\r\n      <label class=\"blueTriangle tans\" for=\"blueTriangle-tan-1-90\" id=\"tanblueTrianglelab-1-90\"></label>\r\n      <label class=\"blueTriangle tans\" for=\"blueTriangle-tan-1-225\" id=\"tanblueTrianglelab-1-225\"></label>\r\n      <!-- labels radio for every possible shape shadows-->\r\n      <div class=\"shape\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </form>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n</div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-2-creating-maps-for-shape-data\">Creating maps for shape data</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now that HTML skeleton is ready, it’s time to inject it with some real power.

Each entry in the map corresponds to an element index (1 through 8) and contains a list of four values: <code>[start-col, end-col, start-row, end-row]</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"SCSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-scss\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@mixin tanagram-grid-positioning($nth-child-grid) {\r\n  // Loop through numbers 1 to 8, corresponding to the tanam pieces\r\n  @for $i from 1 through 8 {\r\n\r\n    // Check if the map contains a key for the current piece (1-8)\r\n    @if map.has-key($nth-child-grid, $i) {\r\n\r\n      // Get the grid values for this piece: [start-column, end-column, start-row, end-row]\r\n      $values: map.get($nth-child-grid, $i);\r\n\r\n      // Target the nth child (piece) and set its grid positions\r\n      &:nth-child(#{$i}) {\r\n        // Set grid-column: start and end values based on the first two items in the list\r\n        grid-column: #{list.nth($values, 1)} / #{list.nth($values, 2)};\r\n\r\n        // Set grid-row: start and end values based on the last two items in the list\r\n        grid-row: #{list.nth($values, 3)} / #{list.nth($values, 4)};\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can expect the following CSS to be generated:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.tanagram-box:nth-child(1) {\r\n  grid-column: 2 / 3;\r\n  grid-row: 1 / 2;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.tanagram-box:nth-child(2) {\r\n  grid-column: 3 / 4;\r\n  grid-row: 1 / 2;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_xbbJoLq\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/xbbJoLq?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=xbbJoLq&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed xbbJoLq\" title=\"CodePen Embed xbbJoLq\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In this mixin, my goal was actually to create all the shapes (tans). I am using <code>clip-path</code>. There were ideas to use fancy SVG images, but this test project is more about testing the logic rather than focusing on beautiful design. For this reason, the simplest solution was to cut the elements according to dimensions while they are still in the square (the initial position of all the tans).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, in this case, through a static calculation, the <code>$tansShapes</code> map was updated with the <code>clip-path</code> property:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">clip-path: (0 0, 50 50, 0 100);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This contains the clip points for all the tans. In essence, this mixin shapes and colors each tan accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"SCSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-scss\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@mixin set-tan-clip-path($tanName, $values) {\r\n  //  Initialize an empty list to hold the final clip-path points\r\n  $clip-path-points: ();\r\n\r\n  // Extract the 'clip-path' data from the map, which contains coordinate pairs\r\n  $clip-path-key: map.get($values, clip-path);\r\n\r\n  // Get the number of coordinate pairs to loop through\r\n  $count: list.length($clip-path-key);\r\n\r\n  //  Loop through each coordinate point\r\n  @for $i from 1 through $count {\r\n    //  Convert each pair of numbers into a formatted coordinate string with units\r\n    $current-point: get-coordinates($clip-path-key, $i, \" \", \"%\");\r\n\r\n    //  Add the formatted coordinate to the list, separating each point with a comma\r\n    $clip-path-points: list.append($clip-path-points, #{$current-point}, comma);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  //  Style for the preview element (lab version), using the configured background color\r\n  #tan#{$tanName}lab {\r\n    background: map.get($values, color);\r\n    clip-path: polygon(#{$clip-path-points}); // Apply the full list of clip-path points\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  //  Apply the same clip-path to the actual tan element\r\n  .#{$tanName} {\r\n    clip-path: polygon(#{$clip-path-points});\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>and output in CSS should be:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.blueTriangle {\r\n  clip-path: polygon(0% 0%, 50% 50%, 0% 100%);\r\n}\r\n/* other tans */</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_bNNxbbW\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/bNNxbbW?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=bNNxbbW&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed bNNxbbW\" title=\"CodePen Embed bNNxbbW\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"start-logic\">Start logic</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Alright, now I’d like to clarify what should happen first when the game loads.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>First, with a click on the Start button, all the tans “go to their positions.” In reality, we assign them a <code>transform: translate()</code> with specific coordinates and a rotation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">.start:checked ~ .shadow #tanblueTrianglelab {\r\n  transform-origin: 4.17vmin 12.5vmin;\r\n  transform: translate(-6vmin,-37vmin) rotate(360deg);\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_LEEJYEx\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/LEEJYEx?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=LEEJYEx&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed LEEJYEx\" title=\"CodePen Embed LEEJYEx\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, we still maintain this pattern. We use transform and simply change the positions or angles (in the maps) of both the tans and their shadows on the task board.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When any tan is clicked, the rotation button appears. By clicking on it, the tan should rotate around its center, and this continues with each subsequent click. There are actually eight radio buttons, and with each click, one disappears and the next one appears. When we reach the last one, clicking it makes it disappear and the first one reappears. This way, we get the impression of clicking the same button (they are, of course, styled the same) and being able to click (rotate the tan) infinitely. This is exactly what the following mixin enables.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"SCSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-scss\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">@mixin set-tan-rotation-states($tanName, $values, $angles, $color) {\r\n  // This mixin dynamically applies rotation UI styles based on a tan's configuration.\r\n  // It controls the positioning and appearance of rotation buttons and visual feedback when a rotation state is active.\r\n  @each $angle in $angles{\r\n    & ~ #rot#{$angle}{ transform: translate(get-coordinates($values,rot-btn-position,',',vmin )); background: $color;}\r\n    & ~ #rotation-#{$angle}:checked{\r\n      @each $key in map.keys($tansShapes){\r\n        & ~ #tan#{$key}labRes{ visibility: visible; background:rgba(0,0,0,0.4); }\r\n        & ~ #tan#{$key}lab{ opacity:.3; }\r\n        & ~ #rotReset{ visibility: visible; }\r\n      } \r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And the generated CSS should be:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"SCSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-scss\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">#blueTriangle-tan:checked ~ #rotation-45:checked ~ #tanblueTrianglelab {\r\n  transform: translate(-6vmin,-37vmin) rotate(45deg);\r\n}\r\n\r\n#blueTriangle-tan:checked ~ #rotation-45:checked ~ #tanblueTrianglelabRes {\r\n  visibility: hidden;\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>OK, the following mixins use the <code>set-clip-path</code> and <code>set-rotation</code> mixins.

    "content": "<p>For years, I believed that drag-and-drop games — especially those involving rotation, spatial logic, and puzzle solving — were the exclusive domain of JavaScript. Until one day, I asked AI:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\r\n<p><em>“Is it possible to build a fully interactive Tangram puzzle game using only CSS?”</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The answer: <em>“No — not really. You’ll need JavaScript.”</em> That was all the motivation I needed to prove otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-386648\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"><iframe id=\"cp_embed_gbOBMqm\" src=\"//codepen.io/anon/embed/preview/gbOBMqm?height=450&theme-id=1&slug-hash=gbOBMqm&default-tab=result\" height=\"450\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allowpaymentrequest name=\"CodePen Embed gbOBMqm\" title=\"CodePen Embed gbOBMqm\" class=\"cp_embed_iframe\" style=\"width:100%;overflow:hidden\">CodePen Embed Fallback</iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But first, let’s ask the obvious question: <em>Why would anyone do this?</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Well…</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>To know how far CSS can be pushed in creating interactive UIs.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>To get better at my CSS skills.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>And it’s fun!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Fair enough?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now, here’s the unsurprising truth: CSS isn’t exactly made for this. It’s not a logic language, and let’s be honest, it’s not particularly dynamic either. (Sure, we have CSS variables and some handy built-in functions now, hooray!)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In JavaScript, we naturally think in terms of functions, loops, conditions, objects, comparisons. We write logic, abstract things into methods, and eventually ship a bundle that the browser understands. And once it’s shipped? We rarely look at that final JavaScript bundle — we just focus on keeping it lean.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now ask yourself: isn’t that exactly what Sass does for CSS?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Why should we hand-write endless lines of repetitive CSS when we can use mixins and functions to generate it — cleanly, efficiently, and without caring how many lines it takes, as long as the output is optimized?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So, we put it to the test and it turns out Sass can replace JavaScript, at least when it comes to low-level logic and puzzle behavior. With nothing but maps, mixins, functions, and a whole lot of math, we managed to bring our Tangram puzzle to life, no JavaScript required.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Let the (CSS-only) games begin! 🎉</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-game\">The game</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The game consists of seven pieces: the classic Tangram set. Naturally, these pieces can be arranged into a perfect square (and many other shapes, too). But we need a bit more than just static pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>So here’s what I am building:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>A puzzle goal, which is the target shape the player has to recreate.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>A start button that shuffles all the pieces into a staging area.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Each piece is clickable and interactive.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The puzzle should let the user know when they get a piece wrong and also celebrate when they finish the puzzle.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-1-html-structure\">The HTML structure</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>I started by setting up the HTML structure, which is no small task, considering the number of elements involved.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Each shape was given seven radio buttons. I chose radios over checkboxes to take advantage of their built-in exclusivity. Only one can be selected within the same group. This made it much easier to track which shape and state were currently active.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The start button? Also a radio input. A checkbox could’ve worked too, but for the sake of consistency, I stuck with radios across the board.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>The puzzle map itself is just a plain old <code><div></code>, simple and effective.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>For rotation, we added eight radio buttons, each representing a 45-degree increment: 45°, 90°, 135°, all the way to 360°. These simulate rotation controls entirely in CSS.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Every potential shadow position got its own radio button too. (Yes, it’s a lot, I know.)</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>And to wrap it all up, I included a classic reset button inside a <code><form></code> using <code><button type=\"reset\"></code>, so players can easily start over at any point.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Given the sheer number of elements required, I used Pug to generate the HTML more efficiently. It was purely a convenience choice. It doesn’t affect the logic or behavior of the puzzle in any way.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Below is a sample of the compiled HTML. It might look overwhelming at first glance (and this is just a portion of it!), but it illustrates the structural complexity involved. This section is collapsed to not nuke your screen, but it can be expanded if you’d like to explore it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<details >\r\n  <summary>\r\n          Open HTML Code      </summary>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><div class=\"wrapper\">\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <form class=\"container\">\r\n    <input class=\"hide_input start\" type=\"checkbox\" id=\"start\" autofocus />\r\n    <button class=\"start-button\" type=\"reset\" id=\"restart\">Restart</button>\r\n    <label class=\"start-button\" for=\"start\">Start </label>\r\n    <div class=\"shadow\">\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"radio\" id=\"blueTriangle-tan\" name=\"tan-active\" />\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"radio\" id=\"yellowTriangle-tan\" name=\"tan-active\" />\r\n      <!-- Inputs for others tans -->\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"radio\" id=\"rotation-reset\" name=\"tan-active\" />\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"radio\" id=\"rotation-45\" name=\"tan-rotation\" />\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"radio\" id=\"rotation-90\" name=\"tan-rotation\" />\r\n      <!--radios for 90, 225, 315, 360 -->\r\n\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"checkbox\" id=\"yellowTriangle-tan-1-135\" name=\"tan-rotation\" />\r\n      <input class=\"hide_input\" type=\"checkbox\" id=\"yellowTriangle-tan-1-225\" name=\"tan-rotation\" />\r\n      <!-- radio for every possible shape shadows-->\r\n\r\n      <label class=\"rotation rot\" for=\"rotation-45\" id=\"rot45\">⟲</label>\r\n      <label class=\"rotation rot\" for=\"rotation-90\" id=\"rot90\">⟲</label>\r\n      <!--radios for 90, 225, 315, 360 -->\r\n      <label class=\"rotation\" for=\"rotation-reset\" id=\"rotReset\">✘</label>\r\n\r\n      <label class=\"blueTriangle tans\" for=\"blueTriangle-tan\" id=\"tanblueTrianglelab\"></label>\r\n      <div class=\"tans tan_blocked\" id=\"tanblueTrianglelabRes\"></div>\r\n      <!-- labels for every tan and disabled div -->\r\n\r\n      <label class=\"blueTriangle tans\" for=\"blueTriangle-tan-1-90\" id=\"tanblueTrianglelab-1-90\"></label>\r\n      <label class=\"blueTriangle tans\" for=\"blueTriangle-tan-1-225\" id=\"tanblueTrianglelab-1-225\"></label>\r\n      <!-- labels radio for every possible shape shadows-->\r\n      <div class=\"shape\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </form>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n  <div class=\"tanagram-box\"></div>\r\n</div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"step-2-creating-maps-for-shape-data\">Creating maps for shape data</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Now that HTML skeleton is ready, it’s time to inject it with some real power.

By clicking on it, the tan should rotate around its center, and this continues with each subsequent click. There are actually eight radio buttons, and with each click, one disappears and the next one appears. When we reach the last one, clicking it makes it disappear and the first one reappears. This way, we get the impression of clicking the same button (they are, of course, styled the same) and being able to click (rotate the tan) infinitely.

    "content": "<p>The <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/poppin-in/\">HTML <code>popover</code> attribute</a> transforms elements into top-layer elements that can be opened and closed with a button or JavaScript. Most popovers can be light-dismissed, closing when the user clicks or taps outside the popup. Currently, HTML <code>popover</code> lacks built-in auto-close functionality, but it’s easy to add. Auto closing popups are useful for user interfaces like banner notifications — the new-message alerts in phones, for instance.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span id=\"more-386694\"></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A <del>picture</del> demo, is worth a thousand words, right?

Slap it on a <code>div</code>, specify the type of popover you need, and you’re done.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><div popover=\"manual\" id=\"pop\">Bookmarked!</div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A <code>manual</code> popover simply means it cannot be light-dismissed by clicking outside the element. As a result, we have to hide, show, or toggle the popover’s visibility ourselves explicitly with either buttons or JavaScript. Let’s use a semantic HTML <code>button</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><button popovertarget=\"pop\" popovertargetaction=\"show\">\r\n  Add to my bookmarks\r\n</button>\r\n<div popover=\"manual\" id=\"pop\">Bookmarked!</div></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The <code>popovertarget</code> and <code>popovertargetaction</code> attributes are the final two ingredients, where <code>popovertarget</code> links the button to the <code>popover</code> element and <code>popovertargetaction</code> ensures that the <code>popover</code> is <code>show</code>-n when the button is clicked.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hiding-the-popover-with-a-css-transition\">Hiding the popover with a CSS transition</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>OK, so the challenge is that we have a <code>popover</code> that is shown when a certain button is clicked, but it cannot be dismissed. The button is only wired up to <code>show</code> the <code>popover</code>, but it does not <code>hide</code> or <code>toggle</code> the <code>popover</code> (since we are not explicitly declaring it). We want the <code>popover</code> to <code>show</code> when the button is clicked, then dismiss itself after a certain amount of time.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The HTML <code>popover</code> can’t be <em>closed</em> with CSS, but it can be <em>hidden</em> from the page. Adding animation to that creates a visual effect. In our example, we will hide the <code>popover</code> by eliminating its CSS <code>height</code> property. You’ll learn in a moment why we’re using <code>height</code>, and that there are other ways you can go about it.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can indeed select the <code>popover</code> attribute using an <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-selectors/#aa-attribute-selectors\">attribute selector</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"CSS\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">[popover] {\r\n  height: 0;\r\n  transition: height cubic-bezier(0.6, -0.28, 0.735, 0.045) .3s .6s;\r\n\r\n  @starting-style { \r\n    height: 1lh;\r\n  }\r\n}</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When the <code>popover</code> is triggered by the button, its <code>height</code> value is the one declared in the <code>@starting-style</code> ruleset (<code>1lh</code>). After the <code>transition-delay</code> (which is <code>.6s</code> in the example), the <code>height</code> goes from <code>1lh</code> to <code>0</code> in <code>.3s</code>, effectively hiding the <code>popover</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, this is only <em>hiding</em> the popover, not <em>closing</em> it properly. That’s the next challenge and we’ll need JavaScript for that level of interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"closing-the-popover-with-javascript\">Closing the popover with JavaScript</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>We can start by setting a variable that selects the <code>popover</code>:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const POPOVER = document.querySelector('[popover]');</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Next, we can establish a <code>ResizeObserver</code> that monitors the <code>popover</code>’s size:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const POPOVER = document.querySelector('[popover]');\r\nconst OBSERVER = \r\n  new ResizeObserver((entries) => {\r\n    if(entries[0].contentBoxSize[0].blockSize == 0) \r\n      OBSERVER.unobserve((POPOVER.hidePopover(), POPOVER));\r\n  });</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>And we can fire that off starting when the button to show the <code>popover</code> is clicked:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"JavaScript\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\">const POPOVER = document.querySelector('[popover]');\r\nconst OBSERVER = \r\n  new ResizeObserver((entries) => {\r\n    if(entries[0].contentBoxSize[0].blockSize == 0) \r\n      OBSERVER.unobserve((POPOVER.hidePopover(), POPOVER));\r\n  });\r\ndocument.querySelector('button').onclick = () => OBSERVER.observe(POPOVER);</code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The observer will know when the <code>popover</code>’s CSS <code>height</code> reaches zero at the end of the transition, and, at that point, the <code>popover</code> is closed with <code>hidePopover()</code>. From there, the observer is stopped with <code>unobserve()</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In our example, <code>height</code> and <code>ResizeObserver</code> are used to auto-close the notification. You can try any other CSS property and JavaScript observer combination that might work with your preference. Learning about <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>ResizeObserver</code></a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>MutationObserver</code></a> can help you find some options.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"setting-an-html-fallback\">Setting an HTML fallback</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When JavaScript is disabled in the browser, if the <code>popover</code> type is set to any of the light-dismissible types, it acts as a fallback. Keep the <code>popover</code> visible by overriding the style rules that hide it. The user can dismiss it by clicking or tapping anywhere outside the element.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If the <code>popover</code> needs to be light-dismissible <em>only</em> when JavaScript is disabled, then include that <code>popover</code> inside a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/noscript\" rel=\"noopener\"><code><noscript></code></a> element before the <code>manual</code> popover. It’s the same process as before, where you override CSS styles as needed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><noscript>\r\n  <div popover=\"auto\" id=\"pop\">Bookmarked!</div>\r\n</noscript>\r\n\r\n<div popover=\"manual\" id=\"pop\">Bookmarked!</div>\r\n\r\n<!-- goes where <head> element's descendants go -->\r\n<noscript>\r\n  <style>\r\n    [popover] {\r\n      transition: none;\r\n      height: 1lh;\r\n    }\r\n  </style>\r\n</noscript></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-to-use-this-method-\">When to use this method?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to implement all of this would be to use <code>setTimeout()</code> to create a delay before closing the popover in JavaScript when the button is clicked, then adding a class to the <code>popover</code> element to trigger the transition effect. That way, no observer is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With the method covered in this post, the delay can be set and triggered in CSS itself, thanks to <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/s/starting-style/\"><code>@starting-style</code></a> and <code>transition-delay</code> — no extra class required! If you prefer to implement the delay through CSS itself, then this method works best. The JavaScript will catch up to the change CSS makes at the time CSS defines, not the other way around.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/creating-an-auto-closing-notification-with-an-html-popover/\">Creating an Auto-Closing Notification With an HTML Popover</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=css-tricks.com&utm_campaign=family_&utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

From there, the observer is stopped with <code>unobserve()</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>In our example, <code>height</code> and <code>ResizeObserver</code> are used to auto-close the notification. You can try any other CSS property and JavaScript observer combination that might work with your preference. Learning about <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>ResizeObserver</code></a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver\" rel=\"noopener\"><code>MutationObserver</code></a> can help you find some options.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"setting-an-html-fallback\">Setting an HTML fallback</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When JavaScript is disabled in the browser, if the <code>popover</code> type is set to any of the light-dismissible types, it acts as a fallback. Keep the <code>popover</code> visible by overriding the style rules that hide it. The user can dismiss it by clicking or tapping anywhere outside the element.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>If the <code>popover</code> needs to be light-dismissible <em>only</em> when JavaScript is disabled, then include that <code>popover</code> inside a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/noscript\" rel=\"noopener\"><code><noscript></code></a> element before the <code>manual</code> popover. It’s the same process as before, where you override CSS styles as needed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<pre rel=\"HTML\" class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code markup=\"tt\"><noscript>\r\n  <div popover=\"auto\" id=\"pop\">Bookmarked!</div>\r\n</noscript>\r\n\r\n<div popover=\"manual\" id=\"pop\">Bookmarked!</div>\r\n\r\n<!-- goes where <head> element's descendants go -->\r\n<noscript>\r\n  <style>\r\n    [popover] {\r\n      transition: none;\r\n      height: 1lh;\r\n    }\r\n  </style>\r\n</noscript></code></pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"when-to-use-this-method-\">When to use this method?</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to implement all of this would be to use <code>setTimeout()</code> to create a delay before closing the popover in JavaScript when the button is clicked, then adding a class to the <code>popover</code> element to trigger the transition effect. That way, no observer is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>With the method covered in this post, the delay can be set and triggered in CSS itself, thanks to <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/s/starting-style/\"><code>@starting-style</code></a> and <code>transition-delay</code> — no extra class required! If you prefer to implement the delay through CSS itself, then this method works best. The JavaScript will catch up to the change CSS makes at the time CSS defines, not the other way around.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com/creating-an-auto-closing-notification-with-an-html-popover/\">Creating an Auto-Closing Notification With an HTML Popover</a> originally published on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&utm_source=css-tricks.com&utm_campaign=family_&utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

있습니다.<br>Webpack 또한 여전히 57.85%가 계속 사용 예정이라고 답변되었지만, 34.54%가 다시 사용하지 않을 것이라고 답해 부정적 평가또한 다른 도구들에 비해 높았습니다.</p><p>신규 프로젝트에서는 Vite나 Turbopack을 선택하는 경향이 강해지고 있는 것으로 보입니다.</p><div

기술 문서이다.</p><p>JavaScript에서 파일 핸들, 네트워크 소켓 등의 자원을 효과적으로 관리할 수 있는 <code>using</code> 선언과 <code>Disposable</code> 인터페이스를 소개한다. 기존 <code>try-finally</code> 패턴이나 <code>AbortController</code>보다 더 간결하고 안전한 자원 해제 메커니즘을 제공하며, 이를 통해 메모리 누수와 같은 문제를 방지할 수 있다. 자원이 명시적으로 정리되는 범위를 선언하고 <code>Symbol.dispose</code> 메서드를 호출하는 방식으로 작동하며, ECMAScript 제안 4단계에 근접한 중요한 언어 기능이다. 복잡한 비동기 코드에서도 자원 관리를 용이하게 해주는 이 기능은 JavaScript 개발자들에게 큰 도움이 될 것이다.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.banjocode.com/post/node/memory-management\">Unpacking Node.js Memory - From Raw Bytes to Usable Data</a></strong></h2><p>Node.js의

설명하며, 대용량 데이터 처리 시 발생하는 메모리 이슈를 해결하는 실질적인 접근법을 제시한다. Node.js 애플리케이션의 성능을 최적화하고자 하는 개발자들에게 메모리 관리의 기초부터 고급 기법까지 체계적인 이해를 제공하는 가치 있는 자료이다.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"https://hub.corgea.com/articles/javascript-security-best-practices\">Javascript Security Best Practices</a></strong></h2><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Ziw!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Ziw!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Ziw!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Ziw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Ziw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Ziw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png\" width=\"466\" height=\"174.75\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":300,\"width\":800,\"resizeWidth\":466,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false,\"align\":null,\"offset\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Ziw!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Ziw!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Ziw!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!-Ziw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd2d764e-4849-44ce-8635-ae05d562465c_800x300.png 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Front-end와 Back-end JavaScript 개발에서 보안 취약점을 예방하기 위한 종합적인 가이드이다. 크로스 사이트 스크립팅(XSS), 프로토타입 오염, 서드파티 종속성 관리, 입력 검증 등 주요 보안 위협과 이에 대한 방어 전략을 체계적으로 설명한다.</p><p>코드 예제와 함께 안전한 개발 패턴을 소개하고, Content Security Policy 구현, 최소 권한 원칙 적용, 보안 헤더 설정 등 실용적인 조치를 다룬다. 또한 npm 패키지 보안 감사, 정적 코드 분석 도구 활용법도 함께 제시하여 개발 라이프사이클 전반에 걸친 보안 강화 방안을 제공한다. 점점 복잡해지는 웹 애플리케이션 환경에서 보안을 강화하고자 하는 모든 JavaScript 개발자에게 필수적인 참고 자료이다.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"https://holdtherobot.com/blog/2025/05/11/linux-on-android-with-ar-glasses/\">Coding Without a Laptop -

VS Code와 같은 주요 에디터와의 통합이 가능하며, 코드 리뷰, 리팩토링, 버그 수정 작업에서 AI 도구의 효율을 크게 높여준다. GitHub Copilot이나 다른 AI 코딩 도구를 사용하는 Front-end 개발자에게 더 투명하고 제어 가능한 AI 코딩 경험을 제공하는 혁신적인 도구이다.</p><h2><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/xuri/excelize-wasm\">excelize-wasm</a></strong></h2><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7-g!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7-g!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7-g!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7-g!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7-g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7-g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg\" width=\"442\" height=\"111.97333333333333\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":76,\"width\":300,\"resizeWidth\":442,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false,\"align\":null,\"offset\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7-g!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7-g!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7-g!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!u7-g!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20750f9b-0f0a-4611-800b-6d8c7d5d0418_4448x1120.svg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>인기 있는 Go 기반 Excel 처리 라이브러리인 Excelize의 WebAssembly 포팅 버전으로, 브라우저와 Node.js 환경에서 직접 Excel 파일을 생성하고 조작할 수 있게 해준다.</p><p>서버 의존성 없이 클라이언트 측에서 복잡한 스프레드시트 작업을 수행할 수 있어, 오프라인 애플리케이션이나 데이터 프라이버시가 중요한 상황에서 특히 유용하다. 셀 스타일링, 수식 계산, 차트 생성 등 풍부한 기능을 제공하며, TypeScript 지원과 함께 현대적인 웹 개발 워크플로우에 쉽게 통합된다. 특히 대규모 데이터셋 처리에도 최적화되어 있어 엔터프라이즈급 웹 애플리케이션에서 Excel 문서 생성 및 편집 기능을 구현하려는 Front-end 개발자에게 강력한 솔루션을 제공한다.</p><div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs=\"{\"url\":\"https://fenews.substack.com/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}\" data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\"><div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">매월 첫째 주 수요일에 여러분을 찾아갑니다!</p></div><form class=\"subscription-widget-subscribe\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"email-input\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Type your email…\" tabindex=\"-1\"><input type=\"submit\" class=\"button primary\" value=\"Subscribe\"><div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\"><div class=\"fake-input\"></div><div class=\"fake-button\"></div></div></form></div></div>",

잘 보여준다. 각 프레임워크별 AI 도구 사용 현황도 확인할 수 있어, 현재 AI 활용 흐름을 파악하는 데 참고하기 좋다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://blog.mgechev.com/2025/04/19/llm-first-web-framework/\">LLM-first Web Framework</a></h2><p>이 글은 LLM(대규모 언어 모델) 친화적인 웹 프레임워크를 설계하고 구현하는 과정을 다룬다. 기존 프레임워크에서 발생하는 문제(예: API 버전 불일치, 학습 데이터 부족)를 해결하기 위해 간단하면서도 익숙한 구문과 세밀한 반응성을 기반으로 한 새로운 디자인 접근 방식을 채택했다. 특히, Revolt를 기반으로 이 프레임워크를 설계했으며, 텍스트 노드와 속성값을 getter 함수로 호출하도록 변경하여 정적 값과 반응형 값을 동일하게 처리하도록 개선했다.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/mgechev/revolt\">Revolt</a>는 이벤트 루프를 기반으로 한 프레임워크로, 정적 값과 반응형 값을 동일하게 처리할 수 있는 기능을 제공한다. 이를 통해 LLM이 정적 값과 동적 값을 구분하지 않고도 코드를 생성할 수 있도록 돕는다. 또한, Revolt를 중간 표현(IR)으로 사용하여 Angular나 React와 같은 일반적인 프레임워크로 변환하는 방법도 제안하며, 상호 운용성을 강화하는 가능성을 탐구한다.</p><h2><a

제한된 활용성으로 인해 충분한 합의를 얻지 못했다.</p><p>이에 대한 대안으로 Composite 제안이 등장했다. Composite는 불변 객체를 생성하며, <code>Composite.equal()</code>을 통해 깊은 값 비교를 지원한다. 이는 <code>Map</code>, <code>Set</code>, <code>Array.prototype.includes</code> 등에서 구조 기반의 키 비교를 가능하게 하여, 동일한 구조를 가진 객체들을 동일하게 취급할 수 있다. 또한, Composite는 객체의 프로토타입을 지정할 수 있어, 메서드를 포함한 구조체 정의도 가능하다.</p><p>이러한 접근은 JavaScript에서 값 기반의 데이터 구조를 더욱 유연하게 다룰 수 있는 가능성을 열어준다. 다만, Composite 제안은 아직 초기 단계로, 향후 TC39의 논의와 발전 방향을 지켜볼 필요가 있다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://2025.wasm.io/\">Wasm I/O 2025</a></h2><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H5Nk!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H5Nk!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H5Nk!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H5Nk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H5Nk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H5Nk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg\" width=\"300\" height=\"83\" data-attrs=\"{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":83,\"width\":300,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":null,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":null,\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":null,\"isProcessing\":false,\"align\":null,\"offset\":false}\" class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H5Nk!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H5Nk!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H5Nk!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H5Nk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d7b71f8-c83b-40c5-9dc9-60eae18a23ec_696x192.svg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>지난 3월 27~28일, 2일간 스페인 바르셀로나에서 진행된 웹 어셈블리 콘퍼런스의 영상이 공개되었다.</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP3xGl7Eb-4OtFH1tcQm6u7_LRED7-3rg\">총 25개 세션 보러 가기</a></p></blockquote><p>주요 세션은 다음과 같다.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHOwhkHv21U&list=PLP3xGl7Eb-4OtFH1tcQm6u7_LRED7-3rg\">Moving Beyond Containers - Introducing Boxer</a> (<a href=\"https://boxer-wasmio2025.spinup.site/\">발표 슬라이드</a>) <a href=\"https://boxer.dev/\">Boxer</a> 프로젝트를 소개하며, 컨테이너의 장점을 유지하면서 WebAssembly의 이점을 활용하는 새로운 접근 방식을 제시한다.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2SWSIThHXY&list=PLP3xGl7Eb-4OtFH1tcQm6u7_LRED7-3rg\">The Future of Write Once, Run Anywhere: From Java to WebAssembly</a> (<a href=\"https://2025.wasm.io/slides/the-future-of-write-once-run-anywhere-from-java-to-webassembly-wasmio25.pdf\">발표 슬라이드</a>) Oracle Labs에서 개발한 Java에서 WebAssembly로의 미래를 보여주는 새로운 프로젝트인 <a href=\"https://www.graalvm.org/webassembly/docs/\">GraalVM</a>을 소개한다. 이 프로젝트는 GraalVM용 WebAssembly 백엔드를 활용하여 Java 코드를 WebAssembly로 컴파일하는 것을 목표로 한다.</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LraPUAV-fOo&list=PLP3xGl7Eb-4OtFH1tcQm6u7_LRED7-3rg\">Smarter Operating Systems Will Use Wasm - The Coming OS Revolution</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/JonasKruckenberg/k23\">K23</a>은 기존 운영체제의 한계를 극복하고, 웹 어셈블리의 장점을 활용하여 새로운 운영체제를 구축하려는 시도다.

Playwright의 <code>toHaveScreenshot()</code> 기능을 사용하면 특정 컴포넌트나 화면의 스냅숏을 찍고 변경 여부를 손쉽게 확인할 수 있다. 예를 들어, 디자인 시스템의 컴포넌트가 의도치 않게 변경되는 경우를 감지하는 데 유용하다. 이 글에서는 실제 테스트 코드 예제와 함께 구성법을 설명하며, CI 파이프라인에 통합해 자동으로 시각적 차이를 추적할 수 있는 실용적인 팁도 제공한다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://0xda.de/blog/2025/04/hiding-elements-that-require-javascript-without-javascript/\">Hiding elements that require JavaScript without

구현되어 있으며, 대부분 TypeScript도 지원한다. 또한 ESLint와의 호환성을 고려해 --report-unused-disable-directives와 같은 CLI 옵션이나 --format 포맷터 설정도 가능하다. 향후에는 ESLint 규칙 마이그레이션 툴도 제공할 계획이다.</p><p>Oxlint는 빠른 속도와 함께, ESLint보다 더 정밀하고 안전한 규칙을 도입할 수 있는 가능성도 있어, 퍼포먼스를 중요시하는 프로젝트에서는 눈여겨볼 만하다. Biome, Rome과 유사한 방향성을 가지며, 린트 도구에 관심 있는 개발자라면 직접 테스트해 보는 것도 추천한다.</p><blockquote><p>[참고] <a href=\"https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc\">Oxc GitHub 저장소</a></p><ul><li><p>린트 외에도 트랜스파일러, 파서, 포매터 등 다양한 도구를 포함하고 있다.</p></li></ul></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://rsdoctor.dev/blog/release/release-note-1_0\">Announcing Rsdoctor 1.0</a></h2><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a

기능으로는 웹 기반 시각화 도구, 과다 포함 모듈 탐지, 원인 분석 트리, 범용적 성능 점수 및 가이드를 포함한다. 특히 번들 크기 증가의 원인을 자동 분석해 주며, 코드 수정 없이 설정만으로 적용 가능하다는 점이 장점이다. 대형 프로젝트의 번들링 병목을 해결하려는 팀에게 매우 유용한 도구다.</p><blockquote><p>[참고] Rsdoctor는

V8 엔진을 기준으로 보면, 코드 프로파일링 후 Sparkplug가 초기 컴파일을 수행하고, TurboFan은 심화된 최적화를 통해 반복문 해체, 타입 체크 제거 등을 진행한다. 만약 가정된 조건이 깨지면 디옵티마이징을 통해 다시 초기 상태로 돌아가게 된다.</p><p>이런 과정은 WebAssembly와 같은 정적 컴파일 기술과 JS의 미래에도 영향을 미칠

특히 CSS는 렌더링을 차단하는데, 이를 개선하기 위해, CSS를 인라인으로 삽입하거나, 중요하지 않은 스타일 시트는 비동기로 로드하는 방법을 제시하였다.<br>예를 들어, JavaScript의 경우 <code>async</code>나 <code>defer</code> 속성을 활용하여 렌더링을 차단하지 않도록 조치할 수 있다.<br>다양한 최적화를 통해

있다. <code>font-display: swap</code> 속성을 사용하고, 폴백 폰트를 웹 폰트와 유사한 크기로 지정하여 이러한 이동을 최소화할 수 있다.</p></li></ol><p>이러한 방법들을 통해 프런트엔드 개발자는 사용자 경험을 저해하는 예기치 않은 레이아웃 이동을 효과적으로 줄일 수 있다.</p><h2><a

Svelte의 창시자 Rich Harrris는 이를 통해 개발자들이 복잡한 학습 없이도 생산성을 높일 수 있도록 했다고 밝혔다. 또한, 그는 현재의 소프트웨어가 전반적으로 불완전하다고 지적하며, Svelte 팀의 목표는 더 견고하고 접근성 높은 애플리케이션을 구축하는 데 있다고 강조했다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://eslint.org/blog/2025/02/eslint-css-support/\">ESLint CSS Support</a></h2><p>지난 <a href=\"https://github.com/naver/fe-news/blob/master/issues/2024-11.md#eslint-adds-support-for-json-and-markdown\">FE-News 11월 호</a>에서 ESLint가 Markdown 파일의 정적 분석을 지원한 것을 소개했다. 이제 CSS 파일을 대상으로도 문법 에러·코딩 컨벤션 등을 점검해볼 수 있게 되었다.

Excalidraw는 웹에서 간단히 그림을 그릴 수 있는 오픈 소스 화이트보드 툴로, 핸드 드로잉 스타일의 스케치를 쉽게 만들 수 있다는 점이 특징이다.</p><p>새롭게 3위에 오른 <a href=\"https://affine.pro/\">AFFiNE</a>는 2023년 36위에서 대폭 상승하며 눈길을 끌었다. Notion과 Miro의 강점을 결합한 차세대 생산성 도구로, 강력한 문서 편집 및 시각적 협업 기능이 주목받고 있다.</p><p>기술적 트렌드와 개발자들의 필요에 맞춰 성장해 온 만큼, 각각이 주목받은 이유를 살펴보는 것도 의미 있을 것이다.</p><h2><a

텍스트(<code>alt=\"\"</code>)로 설정해 화면 읽기 프로그램의 방해를 줄여야 한다고 강조한다. 이러한 내용을 실제 사례를 통해 설명하며, 웹 접근성과 사용자 경험을 향상시키는 실질적인 가이드를 제공한다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-rHmWSZajc\">How React

가져오는 다양한 방법을 소개하며, 빌드 시스템을 사용하지 않는 프로젝트에서도 안전하게 라이브러리를 import 하는 방법을 다룬다. ESM(ECMAScript Modules)과 CommonJS의 차이, import와 require의 사용법, 그리고 브라우저 환경과 Node.js 환경에서 차이를 명확히 설명한다.</p><blockquote><p>저자는 이전 블로그에서 간단한 사이트에서는 빌드 시스템을 사용하지 않는 것이 더 쉽다고 주장했다.<br><a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/16/writing-javascript-without-a-build-system/\">https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/16/writing-javascript-without-a-build-system/</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.rob.directory/blog/react-from-scratch\">Implementing React From Scratch</a></h2><p>이 글은 React의 내부 동작 원리를 직접 구현하며 이해할 수 있는 튜토리얼이다. React의 상태 관리, DOM 업데이트 등 저수준 메커니즘을 분석하고 재구현하면서, 라이브러리가 왜 특정 설계를 선택했는지에 대한 통찰을 제공한다. 직접 구축하는 과정을 통해 숨겨진 동작과 설계 의도를 체감할 수 있어 React를 깊이 이해하려는 개발자들에게 유익하다.</p><h1>📦 코드와 도구</h1><h2><a href=\"https://trynova.dev/blog/what-is-the-nova-javascript-engine\">NOVA</a></h2><p>NOVA는 Rust로 개발된 새로운 JavaScript 및 WebAssembly 엔진으로, 데이터를 숫자나 문자열 등 유형별로 벡터에 저장해 메모리 안전성과 효율성을 강화하고, 참조를 인덱스로 관리해 포인터 사용을 줄이는 등 데이터 지향적 설계를 통해 성능 최적화를 목표로 한다. 객체 데이터를 유형별로 분리해 불필요한 데이터 접근을 방지하며, Rust의 안정성과 성능을 활용해 메모리 취약점을 방지하는 데 초점을 맞췄다.</p><p>NOVA는 아직 개발 초기 단계로, ECMAScript 테스트 제품군(<a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/test262\">test262</a>)의 약 47%만 통과한 상태지만, 새로운 아키텍처와 설계 접근 방식으로 JavaScript 엔진 개발에 흥미로운 가능성을 제시한다. V8 같은 기존 엔진과 달리 메모리와 데이터 접근을 효율적으로 처리하도록 설계되어, 특히 IoT나 게임 스크립팅 같은 특정 환경에서 활용 가능성이 크다. NOVA의 발전과 활용 사례가 기대된다.</p><blockquote><p>다음 발표 영상에서 NOVA의 설계 철학과 기술적 세부 사항을 설명한다. </p><div id=\"youtube2-WKGo1k47eYQ\" class=\"youtube-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{\"videoId\":\"WKGo1k47eYQ\",\"startTime\":null,\"endTime\":null}\" data-component-name=\"Youtube2ToDOM\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WKGo1k47eYQ?rel=0&autoplay=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=0\" frameborder=\"0\" loading=\"lazy\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowautoplay=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"728\" height=\"409\"></iframe></div></div></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/html-to-react-figma-by-ma/chgehghmhgihgmpmdjpolhkcnhkokdfp?authuser=0&hl=en&pli=1&ck_subscriber_id=2915906285\">HTML to React & Figma by Magic Patterns</a></h2><p>이 도구는 HTML 요소를 React 컴포넌트나 Figma 디자인으로 변환해 주는 크롬 확장 프로그램이다.

Vite는 매주 1500만 다운로드를 기록하며 JavaScript 생태계의 필수 도구로 자리 잡았고, Vitest도 Jest를 대체하며 인기를 끌고 있다.<br>그러나, 다양한 도구의 결합으로 비효율성과 대규모 앱의 네트워크 오버헤드 문제가 발현되었고, 이를 해결하고자 통합 툴체인 개발을 위해 VoidZero를 설립하고, Oxc와 Rolldown을 개발하였다. Oxc는 빠르고 메모리 효율적이며, Rolldown은 대규모 프로젝트의 성능을 크게 개선할 수 있도록 설계되었다. 이를 통해 빠르고 일관성 있는 개발 환경을 제공하고, 통합된 툴체인을 구축하려는 비전을 발표했다.</p><p>총 43개의 세션들 중 인기 있는 5개 세션을 소개한다.</p><ul><li><p><a

동일한 프레임워크라고 말한다.</p><p>React와 Angular 모두 컴포넌트 트리를 UI와 동기화하는 방식을 예시로 들며, 흔히 시간에 따른 상태의 반응성 또는 전파라고 불리는 동작에 대해서 React는 <a href=\"https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html\">hooks</a>를 통해, 그리고 Angular는 <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/zone.js?activeTab=readme\">zone.js</a>를 통해서 달성하지만 결국 이들 모두 컴포넌트 트리를 최상위에서 하위로 순회하며 DOM 과의 차이를 찾고 반영하는 것이라 말한다.</p><p>반응형 프리미티브인 <a href=\"https://angular.dev/guide/signals\">Signals</a>는 Ember, Solid, Vue, Svelte 등 대다수의 프레임워크에서 도입되었고, 표준화를 위한 명세(<a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals\">JavaScript Signals standard proposal</a>)로 제안되기도 했다. 결국 모든 프레임워크들은 다른듯하지만, 모두 같은 방향으로 가고 있는 것이 아닐까?</p><blockquote><p>콘퍼런스 세션은 다음 링크를 통해 확인할 수 있다.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grRH8e46Pso\">dotJS 2024

하지만 몇 년이 지나고 보안, 성능, 유지 보수성 같은 기능 외적인 요구사항이 더 중요한 환경에 배포할 기회가 생기면서 관점이 바뀌었고, 지난 몇 년간 경험한 최악의 상황들로 인해 오늘날 대부분의 사람들에게 GraphQL을 추천하지 않는 이유와 더 나은 대안이 무엇인지를 설명한다.</p><p>보안 취약성 측면에선 쿼리 기반의 언어라는 태생적 측면에 비롯되는 권한 부여의 문제와 구문적으로 유효하지만 큰 메모리를 소비하게 만드는 잘못된 쿼리에 대한 파싱 문제, 성능, 커플링, 복잡성 등을 주제로 각 영역에서의 경험을 공유한다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2024/05/28/an-even-faster-microsoft-edge/\">An even

해결한다.</p><p>이 규칙은 개발자가 문제에 대한 생각을 멈추고 5시에 집에 갈 수 있을 때까지 문제 해결을 위한 추상화 수준이 높아진다는 것을 의미한다.</p><p>TanStack Query는 단순한 데이터 불러오기 라이브러리가 아니라 React 애플리케이션에서 서버 상태 관리를 간소화하는 비동기 상태 관리자로 데이터 가져오기, 캐싱, 무효화 등의 복잡한 작업을 처리해 주어 개발자는 복잡한 use effect에 얽매이지 않고 애플리케이션에 집중할 수 있게 한다.</p><blockquote><p>[참고] React Query는 <a href=\"https://tanstack.com/blog/announcing-tanstack-query-v4\">TanStack Query로 v4부터 리브랜딩</a>

그러나 HSW의 낮은 채택률을 포함, 이는 현실적으로 어렵기 때문에 지원을 중단한다고 밝혔다.</p></blockquote><p>이후, 애플의 조치에 대한 <a href=\"https://open-web-advocacy.org/apple-attempts-killing-webapps/\">온라인 청원</a>이 진행되었고, EU 또한 관련 조치에 대한 추가 조사를 진행하고 있다는 소식이 전해지기도 했었다.</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24083511/apple-eu-investigation-web-app-support\">Apple’s decision to drop iPhone web apps comes under scrutiny
