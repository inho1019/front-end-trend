    "title": "How to Discover a CSS Trick",
    "content": "\n<p>Do we invent or discover CSS tricks? Michelangelo described his sculpting process as chiseling away superfluous material <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1191114-the-sculpture-is-already-complete-within-the-marble-block-before\">to reveal the sculpture hidden inside the marble</a>, and Stephen King <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7348210-stories-are-found-things-like-fossils-in-the-ground-stories\">says his ideas</a> are pre-existing things he locates and uncovers “like fossils in the ground.” Paragraph one is early for me to get pretentious enough to liken myself to those iconic creative forces, but my work on CSS-Tricks feels like “discovering,” not “inventing,” secret synergies between CSS features, which have been eyeing each other from disparate sections of the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS\">MDN web docs</a> and patiently waiting for someone to let them dance together in front of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387862\"></span>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"matchmaking-for-css-features\">Matchmaking for CSS features</h3>\n\n\n<p>A strategy for finding unexpected alliances between CSS features to achieve the impossible is <a href=\"https://publish.obsidian.md/followtheidea/Content/John/Recursive+Thinking+-+explored\">recursive thinking</a>, which I bring to the CSS world from my engineering background. When you build recursive logic, you need to find an escape hatch to avoid infinite recursion, and this inception-style mindset helps me identify pairings of CSS features that seem at odds with each other yet work together surprisingly well. Take these examples from my CSS experiments:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>What if <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/v/view/\"><code>view-timeline</code></a> took control of the thing that triggers <code>view-timeline</code>?</strong> This led to a pairing between <code>view-timeline</code> and <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/css/position/fixed\"><code>position: fixed</code></a>. These two features are like a bickering yet symbiotic “odd couple” at the heart of my <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/web-slinger-css-like-wow-js-but-with-css-y-scroll-animations/\">web-slinger.css</a> library for scroll-triggered animations in pure CSS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>What if <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/\">keyframe animations</a> could trigger other keyframe animations?</strong> This idea led to a <a href=\"https://jbsolicitors.com.au/throuple/\">throuple</a> comprised of keyframe animations, <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/style-queries\">style queries</a>, and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-play-state\"><code>animation-play-state</code></a>, which together can simulate <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/worlds-collide-keyframe-collision-detection-using-style-queries/\">collision detection in CSS</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>What if <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_conditional_rules/Container_scroll-state_queries#using_scrollable_queries\"><code>scroll-state:(scrollable: value</code>)</a> could control which directions are scrollable?</strong> That question led to a <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3605655.3605683\">scrollytelling</a> version of a “<a href=\"https://www.cyoa.com/\">Choose Your Own Adventure</a>,” which — wait, I haven’t published that one yet, but when I do, try to look surprised.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"accepting-there-is-nothing-new-under-the-sun\">Accepting there is nothing new under the sun</h3>\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Mark Twain thought <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/843880-there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-new-idea-it\">new ideas don’t exist</a> — he described them as illusions we create by combining ideas that have always existed, turning and overlaying them in a “mental kaleidoscope” to “make new and curious combinations.” It doesn’t mean creating is easy. No more than a safe can be cracked just by knowing the possible digits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings back memories of playing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_III\">Space Quest III</a> as a kid because after you quit the game, it would output smart-aleck command-line messages, one of which was: “Remember, we did it all with ones and zeros.” Perhaps the point of the mock inspirational tone is that we likely will not be able to sculpt like Michelangelo or make a bestselling game, even if we were given the same materials and tools (is this an inspirational piece or what?). However, understanding the limits of what creators do is the foundation for cracking the combination of creativity to open the door to somewhere we haven’t been. And one truth that helps with achieving magic with CSS is that its constraints help breed creativity.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"embracing-limitations\">Embracing limitations</h3>\n\n\n<p>Being asked “Why would you do that in CSS when you could just use JavaScript?” is like if you asked me: “Why would you write a poem when it’s easier to write prose?” Samuel Coleridge <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/537027-prose-words-in-their-best-order-poetry-the-best-words\">defined</a> prose as “words in their best order,” but poetry as “the best words in the best order.” If you think about it, the difference between prose and poetry is that the latter is based on increased constraints, which force us to find unexpected connections between ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the artist <a href=\"https://www.philinthecircle.com/\">Phil Hansen</a> learned that <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YrZTho_o_is?feature=shared\">embracing limitation</a> could drive creativity after he suffered permanent nerve damage in his hand, causing it to jitter, which prevented him from drawing the way he had in the past. His early experiments using this new mindset included limiting himself to creating <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Starbucks/photos/amazing-artwork-from-phil-hansen-were-honored-to-be-part-of-it-httpsbuxcozgys4v/10151485693453057/?_rdr\">a work using only 80 cents’ worth of supplies</a>. This dovetails with <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/19905-perfection-is-achieved-not-when-there-is-nothing-more-to\">the quote</a> from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry often <a href=\"https://uxmag.com/articles/when-theres-nothing-left-to-take-away\">cited in web design</a>, which says that perfection is achieved when there is nothing left to take away.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"embracing-nothingness\">Embracing nothingness</h3>\n\n\n<p>The interesting thing about web design is how much it blends art and science. In both art and science, we challenge assumptions about whether commonsense relationships of cause and effect truly exist. Contrary to the saying in vernacular that “you can’t prove a negative,” <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_hypothesis\">we can</a>. It’s not necessarily harder than proving a positive. So, in keeping with the discussion above of embracing limitations and removing the superfluous until a creation reveals itself, many of my article ideas prove a negative by challenging the assumption that one thing is necessary to produce another.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Maybe we don’t need JavaScript to produce a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/generating-and-solving-sudokus-in-css/\">Sudoku solver</a>, a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/web-slinger-css-across-the-swiper-verse/\">Tinder-style swiper</a>, or a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/slide-through-unlimited-dimensions-with-css-scroll-timelines/\">classic scroll-driven animation demo</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maybe we don’t need checkbox hacks to make <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/time-travelling-css-with-target/\">CSS games</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maybe we don’t need to hack CSS at all to <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/the-what-if-machine-bringing-the-iffy-future-of-css-into-the-present/\">recreate similar effects</a> to what’s possible in browsers that support the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/poking-at-the-css-if-function-a-little-more-conditional-color-theming/\">CSS <code>if()</code> function</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maybe I can impart web dev wisdom on CSS-Tricks without including CSS at all, by sharing the “source code” of my thought process to help make you <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/applying-the-web-dev-mindset-to-dealing-with-life-challenges/\">a better developer and a better person</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"going-to-extremes\">Going to extremes</h3>\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we can make a well-worn idea new again by taking it to the extreme. Seth Godin coined the term “<a href=\"https://seths.blog/2013/09/edgecraft-instead-of-brainstorming/\">edgecraft</a>” <a href=\"https://seths.blog/2013/09/edgecraft-instead-of-brainstorming/\"></a>to describe a technique for generating ideas by pushing a competitive advantage as far to the edge as the market dares us to go. Similarly, sometimes you can take an old CSS feature that people have seen before, but push it further than anyone else to create something unique. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>CSS-Tricks covered <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/\">checkbox hacks and radio button hacks</a> back in 2011.</strong> But in 2021, I decided to see if I could use hundreds of radio button hacks using HTML generated with <a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/a-beginners-guide-to-pug/\">Pug</a> to create a working Sudoku app. At one point, I found out that Chrome dev tools can display an infinite spinner of death when you throw too much generated CSS at it, which meant I had to limit myself to a 4×4 Sudoku, but that taught me more about what CSS can do and what it can’t.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The <code>:target</code> selector has existed since the 2000s.</strong> But in 2024, I took it to the extreme by using <a href=\"https://haml.info/\">HAML</a> to render the thousands of possible states of Tic Tac Toe to create a game with a computer opponent in pure CSS. At one point, CodePen refused to output as much HTML as I had asked it to, but it’s a fun way for newcomers to learn an important CSS feature; more engaging in my opinion than a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target\">table of contents</a> demo.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"creating-css-outsider-art\">Creating CSS outsider art</h3>\n\n\n<p>Chris Coyier <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/is-css-a-programming-language/\">has written</a> about his distaste for the gatekeeping agenda hidden behind the question of whether CSS is a programming language. If CSS isn’t deemed as “real” programming, that can be used as an excuse to hold CSS experts in less esteem than people who code in imperative languages, which leads to unfair pay and toxic workplace dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But maybe the other side always seems greener due to the envy radiating from the people on that side, because as a full-stack engineer who completed a computer science degree, I always felt left out of the front-end conversations. It didn’t feel right to put “full stack developer” on my résumé when the creation of everything users can see in a web app seemed mysterious to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And maybe it wasn’t just psychosomatic that CSS made my head hurt compared to other types of coding because <a href=\"https://samgilbert.net/pubs/Alexiou2009DesignStudies.pdf\">research</a> indicates if you do fMRIs on people who are engaged in design tasks, you see that design cognition appears to involve a unique cognitive profile compared to conventional problem-solving, reflected in the areas of the brain that light up on the fMRIs. Studies show that the <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.070039597\">brain’s structure changes</a> as people <a href=\"https://www.jneurosci.org/content/23/27/9240\">get better</a> at <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living/articles/10.3389/fspor.2024.1393988/full\">different types of jobs</a>. The brain’s <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00075/full\">structural plasticity</a> is reminiscent of the way different muscles grow more pronounced with different types of exercise, but achieving what some of my colleagues could with CSS when my brain had been trained for decades on imperative logic felt about as approachable as lifting a car over my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The intimidation I felt from CSS started to change when I learned about the checkbox hack because I could relate to hiding and showing divs based on checkboxes, which was routine in my work in the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/front-of-the-front-back-of-the-front/\">back of the front-end</a>. My designer workmate challenged me to make a game in one night using just CSS. I came up with a pure text adventure game made out of radio button hacks. Since creative and curious people are <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/shared-noveltyseeking-basis-for-creativity-and-curiosity/F812089A4E78C25A4A01C86EB2C873A1\">more sensitive to novel stimuli</a>, the design experts on my team were enthralled by my primitive demo, not because it was cutting-edge gameplay but because it was something they had never seen before. My engineering background was now an asset rather than a hindrance in the unique outsider perspective I could bring to the world of CSS. I was hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hack I found to rewire my brain to become more CSS-friendly was to find analogies in CSS to the type of problem-solving I was more familiar with from imperative programming:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/\">CSS custom properties</a> are like <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html\">reactive variables in Vue</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <code>:target</code> selector in CSS is like <a href=\"https://info340.github.io/client-side-routing.html\">client-side routing</a> in a single-page application.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <code>min()</code> and <code>max()</code> <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/min-max-clamp\">functions</a> in CSS can be used to simulate some of the <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/boolean-logical-operators\">logical operations</a> we take for granted in imperative programming.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you are still learning web development and CSS (ultimately, we are all still learning), instead of feeling imposter syndrome, consider that the very thing that makes you feel like an outsider could be what enables you to bring something unique to your usage of CSS.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"finding-the-purpose\">Finding the purpose</h3>\n\n\n<p>Excited as I was when my CSS hacking ended up providing the opportunity to publish my experiments on CSS-Tricks, the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/generating-and-solving-sudokus-in-css/#comment-1771282\">first comment</a> on the first hack I published on CSS-Tricks was a generic, defeatist “Why would you do that?” criticism. The other comments popped up and turned out to be more supportive, and I <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/applying-the-web-dev-mindset-to-dealing-with-life-challenges/\">said in a previous article</a> that I’ve made my peace with the fact that not everybody will like my articles. However, this is the second article in which I’ve brought up the critical comment from back in 2021. Hmm…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely it wasn’t the reason I didn’t write another CSS-Tricks article for years. And it’s probably a coincidence that when I returned to CSS-Tricks last year, my <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/time-travelling-css-with-target/\">first new article</a> was a CSS hack that lends itself to accessibility after the person who left the negative comment about my first article seemed to have a bee in their bonnet about <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/whack-a-mole-the-css-edition/#comment-1767099\">checkbox hacks breaking accessibility</a>, even in fun CSS games not intended for production. Then again, limiting myself to CSS hacking that enables accessibility became a source of inspiration. We can all do with a reminder to at all times empathize with users who require screen readers, even when we are doing wacky experimental stuff, because we need to embrace the limitations not just of CSS but of our audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose the reason the negative comment continues to rankle with me is that I agree that clarifying the relevance and purpose of a CSS trick is important. And yet, if I’m right in saying a CSS trick is more like something we discover than something we make, then it’s like finding a beautiful feather when we go for a walk. At first, we pick it up just because we can, but if I bring you with me on the journey that led to the discovery, then you can help me decide whether the significance is that the feather we discovered makes a great quill or reveals that a rare species of bird lives in this region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3G8Utd1OhQ4?feature=shared\">journey versus destination</a> thing to share the failures that led to compromises and the limitations I came up against when pushing the boundaries of CSS. When I bring you along on the route to the curious item I found, rather than just showing you that item, then after we part ways, you might retrace the steps and try a different fork in the path we followed, which could lead you to discover your own CSS trick.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/how-to-discover-a-css-trick/\">How to Discover a CSS Trick</a> originally published on <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=css-tricks.com&amp;utm_campaign=family_&amp;utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

했어요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"176a360d-33e3-80b6-895b-fbde7a4bae62\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">그 결과, 스토리 요소로 인해

    "title": "A First Look at the Interest Invoker API (for Hover-Triggered Popovers)",
    "content": "\n<p>Chrome 139 is experimenting with Open UI’s proposed <a href=\"https://open-ui.org/components/interest-invokers.explainer/\">Interest Invoker API</a>, which would be used to create tooltips, hover menus, hover cards, quick actions, and other types of UIs for showing more information with hover interactions. The Interest Invoker API makes these components declarative and hover-triggered, meaning that you create them with HTML, and then the web browser handles the <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code> events for you, sans JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387925\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>You’d use it like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><a>Interest trigger</a>\n<div id=\"target-id\" popover=\"\">Interest target</div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not stated anywhere that they must be declared as popovers, but they <em>do</em> bake the right accessibility hints in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to spend a little time looking at the pieces of this feature, how they‘re used as currently proposed, and offer a few thoughts based on my experience playing with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to dive in?</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-interest-trigger\">The interest trigger</h3>\n\n\n<p>The <em>trigger</em> is what the user will hover (<a href=\"https://open-ui.org/components/interest-invokers.explainer/#touchscreen\">or long-press on touchscreen devices</a>) to reveal the interest target. I’d call it an “invoker,” but to avoid confusing it with the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/invoker-commands-additional-ways-to-work-with-dialog-popover-and-more/\">Invoker Commands API</a> (which is kind of similar), I’ll stick with “trigger” or “interest trigger” for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interest trigger can be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>a link (<code><a></a></code><a>),</a></li><a>\n\n\n\n<li>a button (<code></code><button><code></code>), or</button></li>\n\n\n\n<li>an image map area (<code><area></code>).</li>\n</a></ul><a>\n\n\n\n<p>And it should have the <code>interestfor</code> attribute whose value should reference the <code>id</code> of the interest target. Here are examples for each supported element:</p>\n\n\n\n</a><pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><a><code>\n</code></a><code><a>Interest trigger</a>\n<div id=\"link\" popover=\"\">Interest target</div>\n\n\n<button>Interest trigger</button>\n<div id=\"button\" popover=\"\">Interest target</div>\n\n\n<img src=\"\" alt=\"\">\n<map name=\"map\">\n  <area shape=\"\" coords=\"\" alt=\"\">\n</map>\n<div id=\"area\" popover=\"\">Interest target</div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If the interest target is a <code>popover</code> (like it is in the examples above), then the <code>interestfor</code> attribute replaces the <code>popovertarget</code> attribute that’s normally required for declarative popovers. So, instead of this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"2\"><code>\n<button>Interest trigger</button>\n<div id=\"button\" popover=\"\">Interest target</div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>…we’re looking at this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"2\"><code>\n<button>Interest trigger</button>\n<div id=\"button\" popover=\"\">Interest target</div></code></pre>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-interest-target\">The interest target</h3>\n\n\n<p>The <dfn>interest target</dfn> is what’s revealed when the user hovers (or long-presses) the interest trigger. Again, this should be a <code>popover</code>, and it’s important to use the right type of popover because <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/clarifying-the-relationship-between-popovers-and-dialogs/\">they have different functional and accessibility behaviors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>popover</code> attributes that are valueless, empty, or use the <code>auto</code> keyword can be dismissed lightly, i.e., using the <code>esc</code> key, or by clicking outside of the popover. When opened, these popovers close all <code>hint</code> and other <code>auto</code> popovers (at least, the ones that aren’t nested).</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><div id=\"target-id\" popover=\"\">Interest target</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"target-id\" popover=\"\">Interest target</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"target-id\">Interest target</div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><code>hint</code> popovers (the newest type of popovers) can also be dismissed lightly, but only close other <code>hint</code> popovers when opened:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><div id=\"target-id\">Interest target</div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><code>manual</code> popovers do their own thing. They can’t be dismissed lightly, don’t tell other popovers what to do, and we can have more than one of them open at a time. They’re <em>suuuper</em> chill.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><div id=\"target-id\">Interest target</div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Open UI’s explainer and Chrome’s current implementation suggest that interest targets disappear on <code>mouseleave</code> regardless of the type of popover we’re working with. But redefining popover behavior in this context (or any context) feels wrong to me. If the interest target’s <code>popover</code> attribute is set to <code>manual</code>, for example, shouldn’t it persist after <code>mouseleave</code>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://open-ui.org/components/interest-invokers.explainer/#accessibility\">Open UI discusses browsers baking the accessibility in</a> depending on the popover type, which justifies interest invokers building off of popovers, but I think accessibility should depend on the content (unless overwritten using ARIA attributes) rather than the popover type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, it seems like interest invokers are designed to be used with popovers but for all the wrong reasons (in my opinion anyway). That said, it’s early days still. Interest invokers are very experimental and it’s certainly possible that I’m overlooking something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re otherwise straightforward, which is on-brand for Open UI (look at the <a href=\"https://open-ui.org/components/customizableselect/\">Customizable Select</a>, after all). They take commonly-used JavaScript-powered components (such as <a href=\"https://open-ui.org/components/accordion.explainer/\">exclusive accordions</a>, <a href=\"https://open-ui.org/components/invokers.explainer/\">invoker commands</a>, and yes, <a href=\"https://open-ui.org/components/popover.research.explainer/\">popovers</a>) and make them possible with declarative HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, there are some JavaScript events that we can use, too. Let’s take a look at those.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"interest-invoker-javascript-events\">Interest invoker JavaScript events</h3>\n\n\n<p>While I imagine that you’d only need to listen for the <code>interest</code> and <code>loseinterestevents</code> for certain edge cases, JavaScript events for these new declarative HTML features are fairly standard, and they’re there should you need them:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>interestTrigger.addEventListener(\"interest\", () =&gt; {\n  /* User showed interest */\n});\n\ninterestTrigger.addEventListener(\"loseinterest\", () =&gt; {\n  /* User lost interest */\n});</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But what does “interest” mean, exactly? That’s worth digging into next.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"interest-delay-and-the-css-of-it-all\">Interest delay (and the CSS of it all)</h3>\n\n\n<p>You’ve probably noticed that when you show or lose interest, there’s a short delay in the popover showing or hiding itself. This is extremely annoying at first, but when you actually start to build with interest invokers, you realize how necessary it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s the demo again, so you can try it out (in Chrome 139 or Canary for now):</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One problem is that if you accidentally <code>mouseleave</code> the interest trigger and the target (which can be very easy to do when the target is too small), then it all disappears. This is even <em>more</em> annoying, but luckily the hide delay allows you some recovery time. Similarly, the show delay offers keyboard and screen reader users the opportunity to skip the interest target, while also preventing it from being triggered accidentally with a mouse pointer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having said that, if the interest target is unobtrusive, then removing the show delay shouldn’t cause any harm. You could also remove the hide delay for keyboard and screen reader users, who aren’t likely to “lose interest” accidentally. We can do this by setting two new CSS properties, <code>interest-show-delay</code> and <code>interest-hide-delay</code>, to <code>0</code>. The default is <code>0.5s</code> and is set on the interest trigger (but not the interest target):</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* If unobtrusive */\n.unobtrusive[interestfor] {\n  interest-show-delay: 0;\n}\n\n/* If keyboard-focused on a trigger */\n[interestfor]:focus-visible {\n  interest-hide-delay: 0;\n}\n\n/*\n  If keyboard-focused within a target of interest,\n  or target of partial interest (these are always keyboard-triggered),\n  the interest trigger that currently has interest\n  or partial interest has the hide delay removed\n*/\nbody:has(:target-of-interest :focus-visible, :target-of-partial-interest) [interestfor]:where(:has-interest, :has-partial-interest) {\n  interest-hide-delay: 0;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Note:</strong> Interest delays are currently buggy, especially with unitless values. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About those pseudo-selectors, though…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, when navigating to an interest trigger using a keyboard or screen reader whose target contains more focusable elements, this is referred to as showing “partial” interest. (I would’ve gone with “potential interest” personally, but I digress.) When this happens, the interest target’s focusable elements actually aren’t focusable (making it easy to skip them, if needed) unless the user hits the <kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>up</kbd>/<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>up</kbd> keyboard shortcut or equivalent screen reader hotkey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s even a message that we can customize by targeting <code>:target-of-partial-interest::after</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>:target-of-partial-interest::after { \n  content: \"Press ⌥↑ to activate.\";\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While you probably shouldn’t change the message content (since it displays the correct keyboard shortcut for the user’s device by default), we can style it by selecting this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user agent also throws <em>this</em> in:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>:target-of-partial-interest {\n  interactivity: not-keyboard-focusable;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>not-keyboard-focusable</code> value is new, and prevents the keyboard focus (like <code>tabindex=\"-1\"</code> but for CSS, which is super interesting in its own right).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A full breakdown because, frankly, that was <em>a lot</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><code>:has-interest</code>:</strong> Triggers with “mouse interest”</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code>:has-partial-interest</code>:</strong> Triggers with “keyboard interest”</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code>:target-of-interest</code>:</strong> Targets with mouse interest</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code>:target-of-partial-interest</code>:</strong> Targets with keyboard interest</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code>:target-of-partial-interest::after</code>:</strong> The message displayed when targets have keyboard interest</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code>interest-show-delay</code>:</strong> The <code><time></time></code> before which the interest target appears</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code>interest-hide-delay</code>:</strong> The <code><time></time></code> before which the interest target disappears</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code>interest-delay</code>:</strong> Shorthand for <code>interest-show-delay</code> and <code>interest-hide-delay</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"it-works-with-anchors-too\">It works with anchors, too</h3>\n\n\n<p>Nothing really new here as far as what we’ve already discussed, but I find it cool that we can use <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-anchor-positioning-guide/\">anchor elements</a> declaratively just like interest invokers:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n<p>On the surface, interest invokers are simply hover-triggered popovers, but touchscreen devices have never handled hovering well. In addition, hovering is susceptible to human-error, and we certainly don’t want to force keyboards and screen readers to tab into a minefield of focusables. There’s a lot to consider, and Open UI have done a wonderful job of ensuring that user agents do the lion’s share of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s still more to consider. For example, <a href=\"https://open-ui.org/components/interest-invokers.explainer/#touchscreen\">how exactly would we open interest targets on touchscreen devices?</a> Long-press + “View more info” from the context menu seems to be the best approach at the moment, but that’s a tough one!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as we’ve discussed, there’s a lot for us to consider, too, such as those delay timings and how interest invokers should be styled. What should interest triggers and targets look like when they have interest? What about the hotkey instruction? We’re talking about some new concepts here, that might require new UX conventions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honorable mention: We’re also getting <code>interactivity: not-keyboard-focusable</code> out of this, which could help us to build keyboard-friendlier components with CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot to love here, and I just know that people are going to create incredible tooltips and hover cards and more with this.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-first-look-at-the-interest-invoker-api-for-hover-triggered-popovers/\">A First Look at the Interest Invoker API (for Hover-Triggered Popovers)</a> originally published on <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=css-tricks.com&amp;utm_campaign=family_&amp;utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

In the future, the Framework Mode is also going to migrate to use React Router RSC APIs under the hood.</p>\n<p>Reading the <a href=\"https://reactrouter.com/how-to/react-server-components\">React Server Components docs</a>, the integration doesn’t look so simple, so I guess most React Router users may prefer waiting for RSC support in Framework Mode.

    "title": "A Primer on Focus Trapping",
    "content": "\n<p>Focus trapping is a term that refers to managing focus within an element, such that focus always stays within it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If a user tries to tab out from the last element, we return focus to the first one.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the user tries to <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> out of the first element, we return focus back to the last one.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This whole focus trap thing is used to create accessible modal dialogs since it’s a whole ‘nother trouble to <code>inert</code> everything else — <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/clarifying-the-relationship-between-popovers-and-dialogs/\">but you don’t need it anymore</a> if you’re building modals with the <code>dialog</code> API (assuming you do it right).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, back to focus trapping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole process sounds simple in theory, but it can quite difficult to build in practice, mostly because of the numerous parts to you got to manage.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387082\"></span>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"simple-and-easy-focus-trapping-with-splendid-labz\">Simple and easy focus trapping with Splendid Labz</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you are not averse to using code built by others, you might want to consider this snippet with the code I’ve created in <a href=\"https://splendidlabz.com/\">Splendid Labz</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic idea is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We detect all focusable elements within an element.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We manage focus with a keydown event listener.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>import { getFocusableElements, trapFocus } from '@splendidlabz/utils/dom'\n\nconst dialog = document.querySelector('dialog')\n\n// Get all focusable content\nconst focusables = getFocusableElements(node)\n\n// Traps focus within the dialog\ndialog.addEventListener('keydown', event =&gt; {\n  trapFocus({ event, focusables })\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The above code snippet makes focus trapping extremely easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, since you’re reading this, I’m sure you wanna know the details that go within each of these functions. Perhaps you wanna build your own, or learn what’s going on. Either way, both are cool — so let’s dive into it.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"selecting-all-focusable-elements\">Selecting all focusable elements</h3>\n\n\n<p>I did research when I wrote about this <a href=\"https://zellwk.com/blog/keyboard-focusable-elements/\">some time ago</a>. It seems like you could only focus an a handful of elements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>a</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>button</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>input</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>textarea</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>select</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>details</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>iframe</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>embed</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>object</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>summary</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>dialog</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>audio[controls]</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>video[controls]</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>[contenteditable]</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>[tabindex]</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the first step in <code>getFocusableElements</code> is to search for all focusable elements within a container:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>export function getFocusableElements(container = document.body ) {\n\n  return {\n    get all () {\n      const elements = Array.from(\n        container.querySelectorAll(\n          `a,\n            button,\n            input,\n            textarea,\n            select,\n            details,\n            iframe,\n            embed,\n            object,\n            summary,\n            dialog,\n            audio[controls],\n            video[controls],\n            [contenteditable],\n            [tabindex]\n          `,\n        ),\n      )\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we want to filter away elements that are <code>disabled</code>, <code>hidden</code> or set with <code>display: none</code>, since they cannot be focused on. We can do this with a simple <code>filter</code> function.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>export function getFocusableElements(container = document.body ) {\n\n  return {\n    get all () {\n      // ...\n      return elements.filter(el =&gt; {\n        if (el.hasAttribute('disabled')) return false\n        if (el.hasAttribute('hidden')) return false\n        if (window.getComputedStyle(el).display === 'none') return false\n        return true\n      })\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, since we want to trap keyboard focus, it’s only natural to retrieve a list of keyboard-only focusable elements. We can do that easily too. We only need to remove all <code>tabindex</code> values that are less than <code>0</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>export function getFocusableElements(container = document.body ) {\n  return {\n    get all () { /* ... */ },\n    get keyboardOnly() {\n      return this.all.filter(el =&gt; el.tabIndex &gt; -1)\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, remember that there are two things we need to do for focus trapping:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If a user tries to tab out from the last element, we return focus to the first one.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If the user tries to <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> out of the first element, we return focus back to the last one.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This means we need to be able to find the first focusable item and the last focusable item. Luckily, we can add <code>first</code> and <code>last</code> getters to retrieve these elements easily inside <code>getFocusableElements</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, since we’re dealing with keyboard elements, we can grab the first and last items from <code>keyboardOnly</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>export function getFocusableElements(container = document.body ) {\n  return {\n    // ...\n    get first() { return this.keyboardOnly[0] },\n    get last() { return this.keyboardOnly[0] },\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We have everything we need — next is to implement the focus trapping functionality.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-to-trap-focus\">How to trap focus</h3>\n\n\n<p>First, we need to detect a keyboard event. We can do this easily with <code>addEventListener</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>const container = document.querySelector('.some-element')\ncontainer.addEventListener('keydown', event =&gt; {/* ... */})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to check if the user is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pressing tab (without <kbd>Shift</kbd>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pressing tab (with <kbd>Shift</kbd>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://splendidlabz.com/\">Splendid Labz</a> has convenient functions to detect these as well:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>import { isTab, isShiftTab } from '@splendidlabz/utils/dom'\n\n// ...\ncontainer.addEventListener('keydown', event =&gt; {\n  if (isTab(event)) // Handle Tab\n  if (isShiftTab(event)) // Handle Shift Tab\n  /* ... */\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, in the spirit of learning, let’s figure out how to write the code from scratch:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You can use <code>event.key</code> to detect whether the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key is being pressed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can use <code>event.shiftKey</code> to detect if the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key is being pressed</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine these two, you will be able to write your own <code>isTab</code> and <code>isShiftTab</code> functions:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>export function isTab(event) {\n  return !event.shiftKey &amp;&amp; event.key === 'Tab'\n}\n\nexport function isShiftTab(event) {\n  return event.shiftKey &amp;&amp; event.key === 'Tab'\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we’re only handling the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, we can use an early return statement to skip the handling of other keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"2\"><code>container.addEventListener('keydown', event =&gt; {\n  if (event.key !== 'Tab') return\n\n  if (isTab(event)) // Handle Tab\n  if (isShiftTab(event)) // Handle Shift Tab\n  /* ... */\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We have almost everything we need now.

'아, 이거다!' 싶었죠.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-800b-bad2-dc86f086d7f9\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">토스가 만보기 서비스를 오픈한 후, 유저 수를 늘리기 위한 여러 차례의 실험이 진행됐어요. 처음엔 친구 추가 기능으로 바이럴을 일으켜 사용자를 키웠어요. 근데 바이럴 효과가 떨어지면서, '올리브영 가면 몇 원 줄게' 같은 개인 미션을 만들었죠. 건강도 챙겨드리고 싶었고요. 그런데 여기서 예상치 못한 문제가 터졌어요. 저희가 유저분들에게 리워드를 드리기 위한 큰 비용을 지출하는데도, 이게 진짜 효과가 있는 건지 성과 측정이 불가능해진 거예요. 결국 만보기는 유저가 증가할 수록 끝없이 비용도 비례하여 증가하는 비용 사업이 됐습니다. 팀 내부에서도 ‘이게 맞나?’ 하는 회의감이 들었죠.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-8086-a00d-d4d17c732c82\"

class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">2022년 이전까지 만보기는 혜택 탭의 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">‘기둥’ 같은 존재</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">였어요. 이걸 없애는 건 상상할 수 없었죠. 사용자들이 만보기를 쓰러 왔다가 ‘행운복권’도 써보고, ‘버튼 누르고 10원 받기’ 같은 다른 혜택들을 자연스럽게 경험했거든요. 만보기가 혜택 탭 전체로 사용자를 이끄는 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">가장 중요한 입구</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">였던 셈이에요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-800b-a661-c10d170c32b1\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">그러다 ‘함께 토스 켜기’처럼 더 쉽고 강력한 서비스가 생기면서, 데이터상 만보기의 1위 자리를 내주게 됐어요. 내부에서는 당연히 ‘이제 만보기를 닫아야 하는 거 아니냐’는 목소리가 나오기 시작했죠. 하지만 데이터를 깊게 들여다보니, </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">떠났던 사용자를 다시 불러오고(부활 유저), 여전히 혜택 탭을 꾸준히 쓰게 만드는 힘은 만보기에 있더라고요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-80cd-aa2e-eec9ecac2b0f\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">사실 (토스 대표인) 승건님과 만보기를 닫는 문제로 논쟁이 붙기도 했어요. 당시 만보기는 이용하는 유저 규모만큼의 비용을 무조건&nbsp; 지출해야하는 구조였는데, 이 비용을 메꿀만큼 이익을 내려면 무조건 그 이상의 추가적인 가치를 만들어내야 했죠. 그때 제가 광고를 담당하는 토스 Ads Product 팀에 있었는데, 솔직히 7개월 안에 그만한 성과를 낼 자신이 없었습니다. 그래서 제가 직접 하겠다고 나선 거예요. </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">만보기를 그만두는 대신, 어떻게든 수익화해서 이 문제를 풀어보자고 결심한 거죠.</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 만보기 자체의 가능성을 더 믿었던 것 같아요.</span></span></span></p><p

버텼습니다. </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">‘나 같은 사용자라면, 보상이 10원에서 8원으로 줄었다고 해서 이 서비스에 아예 등을 돌리진 않을 텐데’</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 라는 믿음이 있었거든요. 그 2원의 차이가 사용자를 떠나게 할 결정적인 이유는 아니라고 생각했어요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-806f-91cf-e7310eb16a54\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">그 전까지 만보기의 목표는 MAU(월간 활성 사용자)를 높이는 것이었고, 그 목표는 이미 달성된 상태였어요. 하지만 저는 돈, 즉 ‘수익화’에 관심이 있었죠. 무엇보다 만보기는 사람들이 알림을 받고 수시로 들어와 걸음 수를 확인하는, 아주 강력한 습관을 만드는 서비스였습니다. 사용자의 일상에 깊숙이 들어와 있는 이 접점을 없애는 건 너무 아깝다고 생각했어요.</span></span></span></p><figure id=\"237a360d-33e3-80f1-8151-fd57c3d6aee0\" class=\"css-of5acw\"><img

시작했습니다. 구글 애즈(Google Ads)를 붙이면 돈이 되겠다는 생각은 있었지만, 진짜 문제는 ‘어떻게 광고를 보게 할 것인가’였죠. 특히 유저분들은은 5초짜리 광고 시청도 꺼리는 경향이 있으시니까요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-8043-aa8c-dd6dbce5989e\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">그때, ‘1원이라도 주면 보지 않을까?’ 이 가설 하나가 떠올랐어요. 결국 포인트를 받자마자 광고를 강제로 보게 하는, 사실 토스에서는 금기시되는 게임 회사 방식을 시도했어요. 저희가 딱 4시간 만에 뚝딱 만들어서 내보낸 기능이었는데요. 놀랍게도, 첫날에만 거의 100만 명에 가까운 분들이 이 기능을 사용하셨어요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-80ae-b292-fda4f52984bc\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">하지만 딱 거기까지였습니다. 한두 번 눌러보고는 더 이상 사용하지 않으시더라고요.그래서 커피 쿠폰을 걸어보기도 하고, 상품권을 주기도 하면서 7개월 동안 정말 다양한 시도를 했습니다.&nbsp; 솔직히 당시에는 제가 광고 수익화에 너무 꽂혀 있었던 것 같아요. ‘리워드를 더 주면 더 보지 않을까?’라는 단순한 생각에 빠져 있었죠.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-8048-b6f6-f8964a249b1f\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">이 실험에서 가장 충격적이었던 사용자 반응이 뭐였는지 아세요? 사실 표면적인 데이터나 댓글에서는 별다른 반응이 없었어요. 저희가 문제의 본질을 알게 된 건, 한 사용자 인터뷰 때였습니다. 사용자분께 평소처럼 서비스를 써달라고 부탁드렸어요. 화면을 켜고, 버튼을 누르시더라고요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-80e7-8e77-dde2fddf5322\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"></span></span></p><p

class=\"css-q3ktjb\">전체 앱 메뉴를 열어서 토스 앱을 위로 쓸어 올려 꺼버리셨어요. </span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">그리고는 제게 오히려 팁을 주시더라고요. </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">“이렇게 하면 광고 안 보고도 포인트를 받을 수 있어요.” \n</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">그 순간 망치로 머리를 맞은 것 같았죠. 아, 내가 지금 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">사용자에게 절대 해서는 안 될 경험을 강요하고 있었구나.</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 그걸 깨닫게 된 겁니다.</span></span></span></p><p

</span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">‘사용자에게 강요해도 결국 광고 매출을 만들 수 없구나’</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 라는 명확한 실패를 확인했거든요. 덕분에 미련 없이, 아주 빠르게 이 방식을 포기할 수 있었습니다. 저희가 만들어야 했던 건 지급하는 리워드 총합, 그 이상의 임팩트였는데... 이 방식으로는 서비스의 지속가능성을 확보하기 어렵다는 결론에 이르렀습니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-809d-b4cc-e213e7847b5e\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">그때 ‘억지스러운 선택’은 결국 통하지 않는다는 걸 배웠어요. </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">좋은 제품이 좋은 성과를 낳고, 상식적인 경험이 좋은 광고 경험을 만든다</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">는 단순한 진리를요. 그래서 지금 돌아보면, 이 실패는 정말 많은 것을 얻게 해준 값진 실험이었다고 생각합니다.</span></span></span></p><figure id=\"237a360d-33e3-8052-a079-c02436ff6681\" class=\"css-of5acw\"><div class=\"css-oni540\"></div><figcaption class=\"css-5ovf3r\"><span

class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">7개월간 실패하며 깨달은 건 딱 하나였습니다. 사용자가 광고를 안 보는 이유는, 광고를 보는 그 시간이 사용자에게 아무런 ‘가치’가 없기 때문이라는 것. 그래서 질문을 완전히 바꿨습니다. </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">‘어떻게 광고를 보게 하지?’가 아니라, ‘어떻게 하면 광고를 기다리는 시간을 기꺼이 가치 있게 만들지?’</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 라고요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-80ba-b3ab-cf04267482f1\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">고민 끝에 답을 찾았습니다. </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">사람들이 정말로 원하는 것을 기다리게 만들면, 그 시간 동안 기꺼이 광고를 볼 것이다!</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 그리고 누구나 원하는 것, 바로 ‘100만 원 당첨’이라는 기회였죠. 축의금처럼 급전이 필요한 순간들을 생각했어요. \n광고를 보는 시간 동안 당첨 여부를 기다리게 하는, 그 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">긴장감의 순간에 가치를 부여</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">한 겁니다. 동시에 사용자들이 박탈감을 느끼지 않도록 ‘꽝’ 없이 최소 2원은 받을 수 있게 설계했고요.</span></span></span></p><figure id=\"237a360d-33e3-80bb-8512-ec466c780a19\" class=\"css-of5acw\"><img

조코딩님께서 핵심을 정확히 보셨습니다. ‘광고 보고 복권 받기’는 광고 시청을 강요하는 서비스가 아니라, </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">보상에 대한 기대를 통해 광고에 대한 거부감을 설렘으로 바꾸는 </span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">서비스입니다.</span></span></span></p><p

‘사용자 혜택’과 ‘서비스의 지속가능성’이라는 두 마리 토끼를 모두 잡는 선순환 구조를 만들었기 때문입니다. 이로써 만보기는 다음 단계를 향한 발판을 마련하게 되었습니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-8052-ad4e-e335ab81817d\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">여기서 중요한 건 ‘보편적 성공’입니다. 저는 한 사람이 10번 광고를 보는 것보다, 20명이 한 번씩 광고를 보는 게 훨씬 더 가치 있다고 믿어요. 그래야 앱 설치나 상품 구매 같은 실질적인 광고 성과도 함께 올라가거든요. 만보기는 마침내 그걸 해낼 수 있는 서비스가 된 거죠.</span></span></span></p><h3 id=\"237a360d-33e3-80d9-b6d7-e1ee698aac42\" class=\"css-1feg9au\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span

옮겼고요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-8004-b2a7-da6539c50b76\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">예를 들어, ‘토스 만보기만의 특별한 혜택은 뭘까?’라는 질문에 대한 저희의 답 중 하나는 바로 ‘보험료 할인’입니다. 지금 만보기에서 특별 약관 보험 할인 이벤트를 하고 있어요. 많이 걷는 사람은 자동차를 탈 일이 적을 테니, 사고 확률도 낮아지겠죠? 그 데이터에 근거해서 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">운전자 보험료를 직접 깎아드리는

    "content": "\n<p>A while back, our man <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/author/geoffgraham/\">Geoff Graham</a> treated us to a refresher on the CSS <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/i/initial-letter/\"><code>initial-letter</code></a> property, but how can you style drop and initial caps to reflect a brand’s visual identity and help to tell its stories?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how I do it in CSS by combining <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/pseudo-selectors/f/first-letter/\">::first-letter</a></code> and <code>initial-letter</code> with other unexpected properties, including <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border-image/\"><code>border-image</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/clip-path/\"><code>clip-path</code></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387827\"></span>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-01.svg\" alt=\"Showing three screenshots of Patty Meltt's website, including a homepage a videos page, and a discography, all side-by-side.\" class=\"wp-image-387847\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Patty Meltt is an up-and-coming country music sensation.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>My brief:</strong> Patty Meltt is an up-and-coming country music sensation, and she needed a website to launch her new album. She wanted it to be distinctive-looking and memorable, so she called <a href=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk\">Stuff &amp; Nonsense</a>. Patty’s not real, but the challenges of designing and developing sites like hers are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a drop cap recap. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/drop-caps/\">Chris Coyier wrote about drop caps</a> several years ago. They are a decorative letter at the beginning of a paragraph, often spanning several lines of text. It’s a typographic flourish found in illuminated manuscripts and traditional book design, where it adds visual interest and helps guide a reader’s eye to where they should begin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Study manuscripts from the Middle Ages onwards, and you’ll find hand-decorated illuminated capitals. The artists who made these initial letters were fabulously called “illuminators.” These medieval versals went beyond showing someone where to start reading; historiated letters also illustrated the stories, which was especially useful since most people in the Middle Ages couldn’t read.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-02.webp?resize=1200%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The first letter is a P that is four lines tall, bold, and colored light gray.\" class=\"wp-image-387828\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-02.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-02.webp?resize=300%2C63&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-02.webp?resize=1024%2C213&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-02.webp?resize=768%2C160&amp;ssl=1 768w\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">A basic drop cap</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the web, drop caps can improve readability and reflect a brand’s visual identity.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a-brief-refresher-on-properties-and-values\">A brief refresher on properties and values</h3>\n\n\n<p>In CSS, drop caps are created using the <code>::first-letter</code> pseudo-element in combination with <code>initial-letter</code>. As you might expect, <code>::first-letter</code> targets the very first letter of a block of text, enabling you to style it independently from the rest of a paragraph. The first number sets how many lines tall the letter appears, and the second controls its baseline alignment — that is, which line of text the bottom of the cap sits on.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>p::first-letter {\n  -webkit-initial-letter: 3 3;\n  initial-letter: 3 3;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Because browser support still varies, it’s common to include both the unprefixed and <code>-webkit-</code> prefixed properties for maximum compatibility. And speaking of browser support, it’s also sensible to wrap the <code>initial-letter</code> property inside an <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/s/supports/\">@supports</a></code> CSS at-rule so we can check for browser support and provide a fallback, if needed:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>@supports (initial-letter:2) or (-webkit-initial-letter:2) {\n  p::first-letter {\n    -webkit-initial-letter: 3 3;\n    initial-letter: 3 3;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>initial-letter</code> property automatically calculates the font size to match the number of lines a drop cap spans. On its own, this can make for quite a first impression. However, drop caps really start to come to life when you combine <code>initial-letter</code> with other CSS properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Tip</strong>: Interactive examples from this article are <a href=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/lab/caps.html\">available in my lab</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"shadows\">Shadows</h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-03.webp?resize=1200%2C250&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The first example is a single shadow and the second uses two shadows to create a 3D effect.\" class=\"wp-image-387831\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-03.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-03.webp?resize=300%2C63&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-03.webp?resize=1024%2C213&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/versal-03.webp?resize=768%2C160&amp;ssl=1 768w\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Text shadows applied to first letters&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/lab/caps.html#demo-2\">live&nbsp;demo</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When I want to lift a drop cap off the page, I can add a single <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/text-shadow/\"><code>text-shadow</code></a>.

It’s an effective way to create visual effects like this right-facing arrow.

A well-designed drop cap adds visual interest at the start of a block of text, drawing attention in a way that feels intentional and designed. Because it’s often the first element the reader sees, caps can carry a lot of visual weight, making them powerful tools for expressing a brand’s identity.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"designing-for-patty-meltt\">Designing for Patty Meltt</h3>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://inspired-design-feitler.squarespace.com/?password=demo\">Patty Meltt</a> wanted a website packed with design details.

CSS has the tools to go beyond the default: gradients, textures, borders, and even complex shapes all help transform first letters into statements. So don’t waste the opportunities that drop caps give you.

반응이 많았어요. 전례가 없던 시도라 상상이 잘 안 갔거든요. 그래서 1라운드는 일종의 튜토리얼로, 토스의 과거 제품만 기억해도 풀 수 있을 만큼 난이도를 낮춰 참가자들이 포맷에 익숙해지도록 했습니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-804e-9e5e-fae241665d09\"

제품이 무엇인지</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 맞히는 거였어요. 핵심은 외부 메이커들이 ‘바이럴 K’라는 지표를 제대로 이해하고, 실제 업무에 적용해 보길 바라는 마음이었죠.</span></span></span></p><figure id=\"233a360d-33e3-8056-8af8-ed31c30c2146\"

도전한 챌린저스에게는 세 가지 단서가 주어졌어요. 영상 속 유튜버 ‘조코딩’ 님은 그중 세 번째 UI 단서를 손에 넣었죠. 반면, 출연자들이 고르지 않은 단서는 유튜브 시청자들이 볼 수 없었는데요. </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">지금 이 테크블로그에서 처음으로 독점 공개합니다!</span></span></span></p><p

안을 들여다보면 동그라미 챌린지에 대한 값진 회고가 그대로 담겨 있었답니다.</span></span></span></p><figure id=\"233a360d-33e3-806f-bf83-e48e447f67ed\" class=\"css-of5acw\"><img

그리기 챌린지는 지표만 놓고 보면 미흡했지만, 인플로우 사일로에는 뜻깊은 실험이었어요. 보상에 대한 기대감이 부족했고, 반복 참여를 끌어낼 매력이 약했다는 두 가지 약점을 뚜렷이 확인한 덕분에, “바이럴 K를 어디에서 끌어올려야 할까?”라는 감을 잡을 수 있었죠. 이 회고를 토대로 팀은 “유저에게 확실한 기대감을 심어 주는 제품”을 만드는 방향으로 한 단계 더 도약했습니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-806f-8739-c5a7505daed1\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">보상에 대한 기대감이 없고 반복 몰입을 유도하지 못했다는 문제가 뚜렷해지자, 이를 해결하려고 떠올린 답이 1라운드 토스의 선택인 ‘복권’이었죠. 공유를 받은 사람도 설렐 만큼 강력한 ‘기대감’을 주기 위해, 제한된 예산 안에서 당첨금 1,000만 원을 실제로 걸었어요. “보상이 극단적으로 크면 기대감이 왜곡된다”는 심리학 이론을 참고하면서도, 비용은 CAC로 대략 계산하고 애매해도 일단 작게 실행해 본 뒤 실패에서 배우는 것이 바로 토스가 일하는 방식이니까요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-80a0-a716-c16c7eebffcc\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span

가장 크게 성과를 냈고 배운 것도 많았지만, 그 뒤로는 새 게임을 내도 쉽지 않았다”고 말해요. 유저들이 비슷한 패턴에 금세 질려버린 탓이죠. 실제로 토스도 복권이 대박 난 뒤, 보상만 살짝 바꾼 복권 이벤트를 몇 번 더 돌렸지만 지표가 시원찮았다고 해요. 보통 바이럴은 두 번까지는 잘 먹히고, 그다음부터 성과가 급격히 꺾이는 경향이 있다고 합니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-80ab-a481-dcf358dcdc10\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">이런 성공과 실패 사례를 공개하는 걸 두고 팀 안에서도 “다른 회사들이 그대로 베끼면 어떡하지?” 하는 걱정이 많았지만, 성은 님은 “이미 다들 따라 하고 있는데도 우리만큼의 지표는 안 나오잖아요. 디테일이 다르니까요”라며 의연했어요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-8016-896d-d8ef4fc8d404\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">결국 잘되는 바이럴은 기대감과 만족감을 동시에 주고, 설명이 필요 없을 만큼 직관적이면서도 반복 참여를 유도해야 해요. 흥미로운 건, ‘복권’에서 ‘한글날’처럼 아이템 유형을 확 바꿔 주면 새로운 초대자가 눈에 띄게 늘어난다는 데이터도 확인됐다는 사실이죠.</span></span></span></p><figure id=\"233a360d-33e3-806f-a201-db510dd2c591\" class=\"css-of5acw\"><img

class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">이었어요. 현장에선 레고 블록처럼 만든 플로우 스텝을 챌린저들이 이리저리 옮겨 가며 열띤 토론을 벌였죠. 실제 서비스에선 이런 식으로 순서를 마음대로 바꿔 볼 수 없고, 결국 유저 테스트나 A/B 테스트를 거쳐야 결과를 확인할 수 있잖아요. 그래서만큼 ‘언더커버 사일로’ 안에서는 그런 제약을 잠시 내려놓고, 시청자분들도 함께 머리를 맞대 보길 바랐어요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-803d-9a2a-f521b56781af\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">‘틀린 글자 맞추기’ 챌린지에서 튜토리얼을 싹 빼고 카운트다운을 맨 앞에 두는 흐름, 한 번에 떠올리셨나요? 제작진과 인플로우 사일로도 한글날 챌린지를 문제로 내기까지 수없이 고민했어요. 처음엔 담당 프로덕트 디자이너가 설계한 디테일이 훨씬 많았죠. 대표적인 포인트가 ‘단계별 시간 배분’이었는데, 카운트다운이 끝나자마자 시작되는 1라운드(튜토리얼 겸용)는 넉넉히 시간을 줘서 누구나 통과하게 만들고, 1~4단계는 비슷한 시간을 유지하다가 5단계에서 시간을 확 줄였어요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-8049-9d44-d8e3145f3b46\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span

class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">를 끌어올리는 것이라, 사람들은 ‘아깝게 탈락했을 때’ 공유 버튼을 가장 많이 누른다는 점에 주목했어요. 만 원 보상을 눈앞에 두고 놓치는 순간, 누군가에게 링크를 보내 다시 도전하고 싶어지니까요. 반대로 초반에 탈락하면 의욕이 꺾이니, 아예 그런 상황을 막아 버린 거죠.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-800a-8eeb-e00875e02b32\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">사실 이 밖에도 손대고 싶은

PO 스토리 영상에는 이미 결정적 힌트가 두 가지 숨어 있었죠. 첫째, 연령대가 높아질수록 공유 지수가 떨어지는 ‘챌린지형’ 제품은 아니라는 점, 둘째, 공유 행위 자체가 사용자에게 행복한 순간을 선물한다는 점이었어요. 결국 과거 토스가 내린 결정을 추리해야 하는 문제였기 때문에, 해당 제품을 실제로 경험해 본 사람이 훨씬 빠르게 답을 찾을 수밖에 없는 구조였어요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-8071-91fc-f1a0424f2eed\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">실제 촬영 전, 리허설 플레이에서는 여러 가지 아이디어가 오갔습니다. “공유만 해도 보상을 더 주자”는 식으로, 친구 초대 1명에 100원, 2명에 500원, 3명에 1,000원을 주는 전형적인 친구초대 리워드 모델도 거론됐어요. </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">하지만 인플로우 사일로는 정반대 길을 택했죠.</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 공유를 해야만 가격이 내려가는, 사용자에게 익숙하지 않은 규칙을 새로 만들기로 한 거예요. 완전히 다른 접근이었지만, 들어오자마자 “네가 좋아하는 이 제품의 가격을 확 깎아 줄게”라는 경험을 먼저 주는 거죠. 바이럴이 되려면 그럴듯한 혜택을 줘야한다 라는 기본적인 가정에 근원적인 물음을 제기한 것이에요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-80aa-a1e1-d12c3541a09b\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">그래서 첫 화면에 들어온 사용자는 ‘가격을 깎아라’ 버튼 하나만 누르면 높았던 가격이 순식간에 뚝 떨어지는 기쁨을 맛보도록 설계되었어요. 이 순간을 통해 “이 제품, 더 싸게 살 수 있겠는데?”라는 기대감을 자연스럽게 학습하게 만들었죠. 그다음에야 “계속 깎고 싶다면 친구에게 공유해 보라”는 메시지를 노출해, 사용자가 스스로 공유의 필요성을 깨닫도록 유도했습니다. </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">다시 말해, 공유 전 보상을 얹어 주는 대신, 가격 인하라는 즉각적인 즐거움을 먼저 제공해 사용자를 끌어들이는 메커니즘을 택한 셈이에요.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-8071-895f-dc30dc61d676\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-8084-ab44-c4468af27f1f\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">지금까지 인플로우 사일로의 비하인드 코멘터리, 재미있게 보셨나요? 이 이야기는 ‘언더커버 사일로’ EP1·EP2에서 더 자세히 만나실 수 있습니다. 다음 편에서는 만보기 사일로의 뒷이야기도 이어질 예정이니 기대해 주세요. 궁금한 점은 언제든 댓글로 남겨 주세요!</span></span></span></p><p id=\"237a360d-33e3-8048-b2c5-fff0c1b3e0b8\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"></span></span></p><p id=\"233a360d-33e3-80be-aa39-e1884ccfaee1\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">Words</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 조성은  </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">Edit</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 김태성</span></span></span></p></div>",

WebSocket은 연결이 기존 서버에 유지 되어야 하기 때문에 커넥션이 늘어나면서 HAProxy를 도입했고 CPU가 15% 이하로 유지되며 메모리도 2GB로 작았지만 사용자가 NAT 뒤에 있는 경우 너무 많은 요청이 특정 서버에 몰리는 문제가 있었다. 이를 쿠키 기반으로 로드밸런싱하기 위해 Nginx의 <code>stream</code>을 사용해서 적용했을때 잘 동작했지만 HAProxy보다 40% 더 많은 메모리를 소비했다. 그래서 세션 기반으로 라우팅하는 경량 프록시를 Go로 구현했고 전체적으로 가장 안정적인 결과를 보여주었다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/quicksilver-v2-evolution-of-a-globally-distributed-key-value-store-part-1/\">Quicksilver v2: evolution of a globally distributed key-value store (Part 1)</a></strong> : Cloudflare 글로벌 네트워크의 핵심 저장소로 개발된 Quicksilver를 개선해 가는 과정으로 이 글에서는 v1과 v1.5를 다룬다. 모든 서버에서 전체 복제본을 가지고 업데이트하는 것을 Quicksilver v1이라고 불렀는데 비용이 커지면서 이를 개선하기 위해 1.5에서는 데이터를 저장하는 Replica와 영구 캐시 역할을 하는 Proxy로 나누어서 사용하지 않는 key-value를 제거해서 디스크를 아낄 수 있게 되었다. 이 변경으로 많은 문제가 있는데 RocksDB에 캐시된 키를 저장하게 하고 비동기 복제를 하면서 일관성을 유지하기 위해 MVCC와 슬라이딩 윈도우를 이용해서 일관성을 유지할 수 있게 되었고 각 서버는 Gossip 프로토콜을 이용해서 다른 노드를 찾을 수 있게 구성했다. 이에 따라 1.5에서는 디스크 공간을 크게 줄이면서 지연시간을 거의 변화 없게 유지할 수 있었다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/driving-content-delivery-efficiency-through-classifying-cache-misses-ffcf08026b6c\">Driving Content Delivery Efficiency Through Classifying Cache Misses</a></strong> : Netflix는 Open Connect 프로그램을 통해서 전세계의 각 로컬 ISP와 파트너쉽을 맺고 맞춤형 서버 OCA를 제공해서 사용자에게 컨텐츠를 더 빠르게 제공하는데 OCA에 사용자가 요청했을때 OCA에서 바이트가 스트리밍 되지 않으면 캐시 미스로 기록한다. 이 캐시 미스에는 컨텐츠가 없는 경우와 OCA 하드웨어가 포화상태라 트래픽을 처리할 수 없는 경우로 구분한다. 이러한 캐시 미스 로그를 수집하여 선호도가 낮은 위치에서 스트리밍 되는 트래픽을 추적하여 효율성을 개선하는 피드백 루프로 사용하고 있다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/behind-the-streams-live-at-netflix-part-1-d23f917c2f40\">Behind the Streams: Three Years Of Live at Netflix.

While the survey isn’t directly related to the&nbsp;<em>code</em>&nbsp;part of what we do for work, I do love the focus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/\">Devographics</a>&nbsp;took&nbsp;<a href=\"https://survey.devographics.com/en-US\">ever since its inception in 2020</a>. And this year it brought us some rather&nbsp;<em>interesting</em>&nbsp;results through the attendance of 8,717 developers, lots of data, and even more useful insights that I think everyone can look up and learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to look at the survey results with an analytical mindset, but wound up pouring my heart out because, well, I am a developer, and the entire survey affects me in a way. I have some personal opinions, it turns out. So, sit back, relax, and indulge me for a bit as we look at a few choice pieces of the survey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s worth noting that this is only <em>part one</em> of the survey results. A second data dump will be published later and I’m interested to poke at those numbers, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387980\"></span>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"an-opportunity-to-connect\">An opportunity to connect</h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-01.webp?resize=1497%2C635&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Country or Region bar chart.

The majority of responses come from the U.S. (26%) but many other countries, including Italy, Germany, France, Estonia, Austria, South Africa and many more, account for the remaining 74%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I am working and communicating with you right now, all the way from Nigeria! Isn’t that beautiful, to be able to communicate with people around the world through this wonderful place we call CSS-Tricks? And into the bigger community of developers that keeps it so fun?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this is a testament to how much we want to connect. More so,  the State of Devs survey gives us an opportunity to express our pain points on issues surrounding our experiences, workplace environments, quality of health, and even what hobbies we have as developers. And while I say&nbsp;<em>developers</em>, the survey makes it clear it’s more than that. Behind anyone’s face is someone encountering life challenges. We’re all people and people are capable of pure emotion. We are all just&nbsp;<em>human.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>It’s also one of the reasons&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sunkanmifafowora.bsky.social\">I decided to open a Bluesky account</a>:&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>connect</em>&nbsp;with more developers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this survey offers insights into how much we care about ourselves in tech, and how eager we are to solve issues rarely talked about. And the fact that it’s global in nature illustrates how much in common we all have.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"more-women-participated-this-year\">More women participated this year</h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-02.webp?resize=1489%2C550&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bar chart breaking down developers by gender.

I’d say 15% is still far too low to fairly “represent” an entire key segment of people, but it is certainly encouraging to see a greater slice in this particular survey. We need more women in this male-dominated industry.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"experience-over-talent-on-pay\">Experience over talent</h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=1475%2C776&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bar chart showing income ranges based on years of experience.\" class=\"wp-image-388013\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?w=1475&amp;ssl=1 1475w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=300%2C158&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=1024%2C539&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-03.webp?resize=768%2C404&amp;ssl=1 768w\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to popular opinion,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/02/youre-not-paid-based-on-your-performance\">personal performance does not usually equate to higher pay</a>, and this is reflected in the results of this survey. It’s more like, the more experienced you are, the more you’re paid. But even that’s not the full story. If you’re new to the field, you still have to do some personal marketing, find and keep a mentor, and a whole bunch of stuff. Cassidy shares some nice insights on this in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/zhFQtbWJFO4\">a video interview tracing her development career</a>. You should check it out, especially if you’re just starting out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice that the average income for those with 10-14 of experience ($115,833) is on par with those with between 15-29 years of experience ($118,000) and not far from those with 30+ years ($120,401). Experience appears to influence income, but perhaps not to the extent you would think, or else we’d see a wider gap between those with 15 years versus those with more than double the service time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than that, notice how income for the most experienced developers (30+ years) is larger on <em>average</em> but the range of how much they make is lower than than those with 10-29 years under their belts. I’m curious what causes that decline. Is it a lack of keeping up with what’s new? Is it ageism? I’m sure there are lots of explanations.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lessons-i-learned-from-the-stats\">Salary, workplace, and job hunting</h3>\n\n\n<p>I prefer not drill into each and every report. I’m interested in very specific areas that are covered in the survey. And what I take away from the survey is bound to be different than your takeaways, despite numbers being what they are. So, here are a few highlights of what stood out to me personally as I combed through the results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your experience, employment status, and company’s employer count <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#years_of_experience\">seem to directly affect pay</a>. </strong>For example, full-timers report higher salaries&nbsp;than freelancers. I suppose that makes sense, but I doubt it provides the full picture because freelancers freelance for a number of reasons, whether its flexible hours, having more choice to choose their projects, or having personal constraints that limit how much they can work. In some ways, <a href=\"https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/ludics-guide-to-getting-software-engineering-jobs/\">freelancers are able to command higher pay while working less</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#career_issues\">Bad management and burnout seem to be the most talked-about</a> issues in the workplace.</strong> Be on guard during interviews, look up reviews about the company you’re about to work for, and make sure there are far fewer complaints than accolades. Make sure you’re not being too worked up during work hours;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ciphr.com/blog/regular-breaks-at-work#:~:text=According%20to%20The%20Wellbeing%20Thesis,a%20more%20sustainable%20work%20routine.\">breaks are essential for a boost in productivity</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#discrimination_issues\">Seventy percent of folks reported <em>no</em> discrimination in the workplace</a>,</strong> which means we’re perhaps doing something right. That said, it’s still disheartening that 30% experience some form of discrimination and lowering that figure is something we ought to aim for. I’m hoping companies — particularly the tech giants in our space — take note of this and enforce laws and policies surrounding this. Still, we can always call out discriminatory behavior and make corrections where necessary. And who’s to say that everyone who answered the survey felt safe sharing that sort of thing?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/combating-workplace-challenges-silence-enemy-sylvia-lafair-ereuf/\">Silence can be the enemy of progress.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Never get too comfortable&nbsp;in your job.</strong> Although <a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#laid_off\">69% report having never been laid off</a>, I still think that job security is brittle in this space. Always learn, build, and if possible, try to look for other sources of income. Layoffs are&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;happening, and looking at the news, it’s likely to continue for the foreseeable future, with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/career/#laid_off\">U.S., Australia, and U.K. being leading the way</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One number that jumped off the page for me is that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/workplace/#job_finding_application_count\">it takes an average of four applications for most developers to find a new job</a>.</strong> This bamboozles me. I’m looking for a full-time role (yes, I’m available!), and I regularly apply for more than four jobs in a given day. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, but that’s also not consistent with those in my social and professional circles. I know and see plenty of people who are working hard to find work, and the number of jobs they apply for has to bring that number up. Four applications seems way low, though I don’t have the quantitative proof for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your personal network is still the best way to find a job.</strong> We will always and forever be&nbsp;<em>social animals,</em>&nbsp;and I think that’s why most survey participants say that coworker relationships are the greatest perk of a job. I find this to be true with my work here at CSS-Tricks. I get to collaborate with other like-minded CSS and front-end enthusiasts far and wide. I’ve developed close relationships with the editors and other writers, and that’s something I value more than any other benefits I could get somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compensation is still a top workplace challenge.</strong> JavaScript is still the king of programming (bias alert), taking the top spot as the most popular programming language. I know you’re interested, that CSS came in at third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To my surprise, <strong>Bluesky is more popular amongst developers than X</strong>. I didn’t realize how much toxicity I’ve been exposed to at X until&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sunkanmifafowora.bsky.social\">I opened a Bluesky account</a>. I hate saying that the “engagement” is better, or some buzz-worthy thing like that, but I do experience more actual discussions over at Bluesky than I have for a long time at X. And many of you report the same. I hasten to say that Bluesky is a direct replacement for what X (let’s face it, Twitter) used to be, but it seems we at least have a better alternative.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"health-is-wealth\">Health issues</h3>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/devs-04.webp?resize=1542%2C755&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bar chart showing health issues.

Embrace your body for what it is: your temple. It’s a symbiotic relationship. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>— <a href=\"https://www.nnlightsbookheaven.com/post/2018/11/08/without-good-health-youve-got-nothing-going-on-thursdaythoughts-inspiration-health\"><em>Mrs. N.</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m looking closer at the survey’s results on health because of the sheer number of responses that report health issues. I struggle with issues, like back pains, and that forced me to upgrade my work environment with a proper desk and chair. I tend to code on my bed, and well,&nbsp;<em>it worked</em>. But perhaps it wasn’t the best thing for my physical health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know we can fall into the stereotype of people who spend 8-12 hours staring at two big monitors, sitting in a plush gaming chair, while frantically typing away at a mechanical keyboard. You know, the <em><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/\">Hackers</a></em> stereotype. I know that isn’t an accurate portrayal of who we are, but it’s easy to become that because of how people look at and understand our work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you feel a great deal of pressure to keep up with that image, I think it’s worth getting into a more healthy mindset, one that gets more than a few hours of sleep, prioritizes exercise, maintains a balanced diet, and all those things we know are ultimately good for us. Even though 20% of folks say they have no health issues at all, a whopping 80% struggle with health issues ranging from sleep deprivation to keeping a healthy weight. <strong>You are important and deserve to feel healthy.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about your health the way you think about the UI/UX of the websites you design and build. It makes up&nbsp;<em>a part</em>&nbsp;of the design, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/micro-interactions-ux?srsltid=AfmBOorSVn_A8Vm9_NtDe7YPy6BBOw2VJxG1cMqJzRguxm4Rw3jsNKUE\">has the crucial role of turning ordinary tasks into enjoyable experiences</a>, which in turn, transforms into an overall beautiful experience for the user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your health is the same. Those small parts often overlooked can and will affect the great machine that is your body.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@mikael_55667/how-i-try-to-stay-healthy-as-a-developer-8076f3ff0cde\">Here’s a small list of life improvements you can make right now</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"closing-thoughts\">Closing thoughts</h3>\n\n\n<p>Diversity, representation, experience, income, and health. That’s what stood out to me in the 2025 State of Devs survey results. I see positive trends in the numbers, but also a huge amount of opportunity to be better, particularly when it comes being more inclusive of women, providing ample chances for upward mobility based on experience, and how we treat ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US/\">Please check out the results</a>&nbsp;and see what stands out to you.

    "title": "Setting Line Length in CSS (and Fitting Text to a Container)",
    "content": "\n<p>First, what is line length? <dfn>Line length</dfn> is the length of a container that holds a body of multi-line text. “Multi-line” is the key part here, because text becomes less readable if the beginning of a line of text is too far away from the end of the prior line of text. This causes users to reread lines by mistake, and generally get lost while reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) gives us a pretty hard rule to follow: <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation\">no more than 80 characters on a line</a> (40 if the language is Chinese, Japanese, or Korean), which is super easy to implement using character (<code>ch</code>) units:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>width: 80ch;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The width of <code>1ch</code> is equal to the width of the number <code>0</code> in your chosen font, so the exact width depends on the font.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387679\"></span>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"setting-the-optimal-line-length\">Setting the <em>optimal</em> line length</h3>\n\n\n<p>Just because you’re allowed up to 80 characters on a line, it doesn’t mean that you <em>have</em> to aim for that number. A study by the <a href=\"https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability\">Baymard Institute</a> revealed that a line length of 50-75 characters is the optimal length — this takes into consideration that smaller line lengths mean more lines and, therefore, more opportunities for users to make reading mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, we also have responsive design to think about, so setting a minimum width (e.g., <code>min-width: 50ch</code>) isn’t a good idea because you’re unlikely to fit 50 characters on a line with, for example, a screen/window size that is 320 pixels wide. So, there’s a bit of nuance involved, and the best way to handle that is by combining the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/c/clamp/\"><code>clamp()</code></a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/min/\"><code>min()</code></a> functions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><code>clamp()</code>:</strong> Set a fluid value that’s relative to a container using percentage, viewport, or container query units, but with minimum and maximum constraints.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code>min()</code>:</strong> Set the smallest value from a list of comma-separated values.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with <code>min()</code>. One of the arguments is <code>93.75vw</code>. Assuming that the container extends across the whole viewport, this’d equal <code>300px</code> when the viewport width is <code>320px</code> (allowing for <code>20px</code> of spacing to be distributed as you see fit) and <code>1350px</code> when the viewport width is <code>1440px</code>. However, for as long as the other argument (<code>50ch</code>) is the smallest of the two values, that’s the value that <code>min()</code> will resolve to.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>min(93.75vw, 50ch);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Next is <code>clamp()</code>, which accepts three arguments in the following order: the minimum, preferred, and maximum values. This is how we’ll set the line length.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the minimum, you’d plug in your <code>min()</code> function, which sets the <code>50ch</code> line length but only conditionally. For the maximum, I suggest <code>75ch</code>, as mentioned before. The preferred value is totally up to you — this will be the width of your container when not hitting the minimum or maximum.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>width: clamp(min(93.75vw, 50ch), 70vw, 75ch);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, you can use <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/min/\"><code>min()</code></a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/m/max/\"><code>max()</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-calc-in-css/\"><code>calc()</code></a> in any of those arguments to add further nuance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the container feels too narrow, then the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/font-size/\"><code>font-size</code></a> might be too large. If it feels too wide, then the <code>font-size</code> might be too small.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fit-text-to-container-with-javascript-\">Fit text to container (with JavaScript)</h3>\n\n\n<p>You know that design trend where text is made to fit the width of a container? Typically, to utilize as much of the available space as possible? You’ll often see it applied to headings on marketing pages and blog posts. Well, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/fitting-text-to-a-container/\">Chris wrote about it</a> back in 2018, rounding up several ways to achieve the effect with JavaScript or jQuery, unfortunately with limitations. However, the ending reveals that you can just use SVG as long as you know the <code>viewBox</code> values, and I actually have a trick for getting them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it still requires 3-5 lines of JavaScript, it’s the shortest method I’ve found. It also slides into HTML and CSS perfectly, particularly since the SVG inherits many CSS properties (including the color, thanks to <code>fill: currentColor</code>):</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><h1 class=\"container\">\n  <svg>\n    <text>Fit text to container</text>\n  </svg>\n</h1></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>h1.container {\n  /* Container size */\n  width: 100%;\n\n  /* Type styles (</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* Select all SVGs */\nconst svg = document.querySelectorAll(\"svg\");\n\n/* Loop all SVGs */\nsvg.forEach(element =&gt; {\n  /* Get bounding box of </code></pre>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"fit-text-to-container-pure-css-\">Fit text to container (pure CSS)</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you’re hell-bent on a pure-CSS method, you <em>are</em> in luck. However, despite the insane things that we can do with CSS these days, <a href=\"https://kizu.dev/fit-to-width/\">Roman Komarov’s fit-to-width hack</a> is a bit complicated (albeit rather impressive). Here’s the gist of it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The text is duplicated a couple of times (although hidden accessibly with <code>aria-hidden</code> and hidden literally with <code>visibility: hidden</code>) so that we can do math with the hidden ones, and then apply the result to the visible one.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using container queries/container query units, the math involves dividing the inline size of the text by the inline size of the container to get a scaling factor, which we then use on the visible text’s <code>font-size</code> to make it grow or shrink.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>To make the scaling factor unitless, we use the <a href=\"https://dev.to/janeori/css-type-casting-to-numeric-tanatan2-scalars-582j\"><code>tan(atan2())</code> type-casting trick</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Certain custom properties must be registered using the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/p/property/\"><code>@property</code></a> at-rule (otherwise they don’t work as intended).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The final <code>font-size</code> value utilizes <code>clamp()</code> to set minimum and maximum font sizes, but these are optional.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><span class=\"text-fit\">\n  <span>\n    <span class=\"text-fit\">\n      <span><span>fit-to-width text</span></span>\n      <span aria-hidden=\"true\">fit-to-width text</span>\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  <span aria-hidden=\"true\">fit-to-width text</span>\n</span></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.text-fit {\n  display: flex;\n  container-type: inline-size;\n\n  --captured-length: initial;\n  --support-sentinel: var(--captured-length, 9999px);\n\n  &amp; &gt; [aria-hidden] {\n    visibility: hidden;\n  }\n\n  &amp; &gt; :not([aria-hidden]) {\n    flex-grow: 1;\n    container-type: inline-size;\n\n    --captured-length: 100cqi;\n    --available-space: var(--captured-length);\n\n    &amp; &gt; * {\n      --support-sentinel: inherit;\n      --captured-length: 100cqi;\n      --ratio: tan(\n        atan2(\n          var(--available-space),\n          var(--available-space) - var(--captured-length)\n        )\n      );\n      --font-size: clamp(\n        1em,\n        1em * var(--ratio),\n        var(--max-font-size, infinity * 1px) - var(--support-sentinel)\n      );\n      inline-size: var(--available-space);\n\n      &amp;:not(.text-fit) {\n        display: block;\n        font-size: var(--font-size);\n\n        @container (inline-size &gt; 0) {\n          white-space: nowrap;\n        }\n      }\n\n      /* Necessary for variable fonts that use optical sizing */\n      &amp;.text-fit {\n        --captured-length2: var(--font-size);\n        font-variation-settings: \"opsz\" tan(atan2(var(--captured-length2), 1px));\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n@property --captured-length {\n  syntax: \"\";\n  initial-value: 0px;\n  inherits: true;\n}\n\n@property --captured-length2 {\n  syntax: \"\";\n  initial-value: 0px;\n  inherits: true;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"watch-for-new-text-grow-text-shrink-properties\">Watch for new <code>text-grow</code>/<code>text-shrink</code> properties</h4>\n\n\n<p>To make fitting text to a container possible in just <em>one</em> line of CSS, <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2528\">a number of solutions have been discussed</a>. The favored solution seems to be two new <a href=\"https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/css-fit-text/blob/main/README.md#potential-solution\"><code>text-grow</code> and <code>text-shrink</code> properties</a>. Personally, I don’t think we need two different properties. In fact, I prefer the simpler alternative, <a href=\"https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/css-fit-text/blob/main/README.md#considered-alternatives\"><code>font-size: fit-width</code></a>, but since <code>text-grow</code> and <code>text-shrink</code> are already on the table (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/I3aG24t4bwI/m/xLBLyAJKDwAJ\">Chrome intends to prototype</a> and you can <a href=\"https://chromestatus.com/feature/5104141688635392?gate=5084590997504000\">track it</a>), let’s take a look at how they could work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing that you need to know is that, as proposed, the <code>text-grow</code> and <code>text-shrink</code> properties can apply to multiple lines of wrapped text within a container, and that’s huge because we can’t do that with my JavaScript technique or Roman’s CSS technique (where each line needs to have its own container).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both have the same syntax, and you’ll need to use both if you want to allow both growing <em>and</em> shrinking:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>text-grow:  ? ?;\ntext-shrink:  ? ?;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><code></code></strong>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>per-line</code>: For <code>text-grow</code>, lines of text shorter than the container will grow to fit it. For <code>text-shrink</code>, lines of text <em>longer</em> than the container will <em>shrink</em> to fit it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>consistent</code>: For <code>text-grow</code>, the shortest line will grow to fit the container while all other lines grow by the same scaling factor. For <code>text-shrink</code>, the <em>longest</em> line will <em>shrink</em> to fit the container while all other lines shrink by the same scaling factor.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code></code></strong> (optional)\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>scale</code>: Scale the glyphs instead of changing the <code>font-size</code>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>scale-inline</code>: Scale the glyphs instead of changing the <code>font-size</code>, but only horizontally.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>font-size</code>: Grow or shrink the font size accordingly. (I don’t know what the default value would be, but I imagine this would be it.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>letter-spacing</code>: The letter spacing will grow/shrink instead of the <code>font-size</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code></code></strong> (optional): The maximum font size for <code>text-grow</code> or minimum font size for <code>text-shrink</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I think I prefer the <code>font-size: fit-width</code> approach as this would grow and shrink all lines to fit the container in just one line of CSS. The above proposal does way more than I want it to, and there are already <a href=\"https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/css-fit-text/blob/main/README.md#detailed-design-discussion\">a number of roadblocks</a> to overcome (many of which are accessibility-related). That’s just me, though, and I’d be curious to know your thoughts in the comments.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n<p>It’s easier to set line length with CSS now than it was a few years ago. Now we have character units, <code>clamp()</code> and <code>min()</code> (and <code>max()</code> and <code>calc()</code> if you wanted to throw those in too), and wacky things that we can do with SVGs and CSS to fit text to a container. It does look like <code>text-grow</code> and <code>text-shrink</code> (or an equivalent solution) are what we truly need though, at least in some scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until we get there, this is a good time to weigh-in, which you can do by adding your feedback, tests, and use-cases to the <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/2528\">GitHub issue</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/setting-line-length-in-css-and-fitting-text-to-a-container/\">Setting Line Length in CSS (and Fitting Text to a Container)</a> originally published on <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=css-tricks.com&amp;utm_campaign=family_&amp;utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

    "title": "Scroll-Driven Sticky Heading",
    "content": "\n<p>Scroll-driven animations are great! They’re a powerful tool that lets developers tie the movement and transformation of elements directly to the user’s scroll position. This technique opens up new ways to create interactive experiences, cuing images to appear, text to glide across the stage, and backgrounds to subtly shift. Used thoughtfully, scroll-driven animations (SDA) can make your website feel more dynamic, engaging, and responsive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few weeks back, I was playing around with scroll-driven animations, just searching for all sorts of random things you could do with it. That’s when I came up with the idea to animate the text of the main heading (<code>h1</code>) and, using SDA, change the heading itself based on the user’s scroll position on the page. In this article, we’re going to break down that idea and rebuild it step by step. This is the general direction we’ll be heading in, which looks better <a href=\"https://codepen.io/amit_sheen/full/jEPRPXG/8f961cc6db1cac0c976bec7bd4bdd57f\">in full screen</a> and viewed in a Chromium browser:</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387748\"></span>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to note that the effect in this example only works in browsers that support scroll-driven animations. Where SDA isn’t supported, there’s a proper fallback to static headings. From an accessibility perspective, if the browser has reduced motion enabled or if the page is being accessed with assistive technology, the effect is disabled and the user gets all the content in a fully semantic and accessible way.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Just a quick note:</strong> this approach does rely on a few <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/magic-numbers-in-css/\">“magic numbers”</a> for the keyframes, which we’ll talk about later on. While they’re surprisingly responsive, this method is really best suited for static content, and it’s not ideal for highly dynamic websites.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"closer-look-at-the-animation\">Closer Look at the Animation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into scroll-driven animations, let’s take a minute to look at the text animation itself, and how it actually works. This is based on an idea I had a few years back when I wanted to create a typewriter effect. At the time, most of the methods I found involved animating the element’s width, required using a monospace font, or a solid color background. None of which really worked for me. So I looked for a way to animate the content itself, and the solution was, as it often is, in pseudo-elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Pseudo-elements have a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/content/\"><code>content</code></a> property, and you can (kind of) animate that text. It’s not exactly animation, but you can change the content dynamically. The cool part is that the only thing that changes is the text itself, no other tricks required.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"start-with-a-solid-foundation\">Start With a Solid Foundation</h3>\n\n\n<p>Now that you know the trick behind the text animation, let’s see how to combine it with a scroll-driven animation, and make sure we have a solid, accessible fallback as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll start with some basic semantic markup. I’ll wrap everything in a <code>main</code> element, with individual sections inside. Each <code>section</code> gets its own heading and content, like text and images. For this example, I’ve set up four sections, each with a bit of text and some images, all about Primary Colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><main>\n  <section>\n    <h1>Primary Colors</h1>\n    <p>The three primary colors (red, blue, and yellow) form the basis of all other colors on the color wheel. Mixing them in different combinations produces a wide array of hues.</p>\n    <img alt=\"...image description\">\n  </section>\n  \n  <section>\n    <h2>Red Power</h2>\n    <p>Red is a bold and vibrant color, symbolizing energy, passion, and warmth. It easily attracts attention and is often linked with strong emotions.</p>\n    <img alt=\"...image description\">\n  </section>\n  \n  <section>\n    <h2>Blue Calm</h2>\n    <p>Blue is a calm and cool color, representing tranquility, stability, and trust. It evokes images of the sky and sea, creating a peaceful mood.</p>\n    <img alt=\"...image description\">\n  </section>\n  \n  <section>\n    <h2>Yellow Joy</h2>\n    <p>Yellow is a bright and cheerful color, standing for light, optimism, and creativity. It is highly visible and brings a sense of happiness and hope.</p>\n    <img alt=\"...image description\">\n  </section>\n</main></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the styling, I’m not doing anything special at this stage, just the basics. I changed the font and adjusted the text and heading sizes, set up the <code>display</code> for the <code>main</code> and the <code>section</code>s, and fixed the image sizes with <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/object-fit/\"><code>object-fit</code></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, at this point, we have a simple site with static, semantic, and accessible content, which is great. Now the goal is to make sure it stays that way as we start adding our effect.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-second-first-heading\">The Second First Heading</h3>\n\n\n<p>We’ll start by adding another <code>h1</code> element at the top of the <code>main</code>. This new element will serve as the placeholder for our animated text, updating according to the user’s scroll position. And yes, I know there’s already an <code>h1</code> in the first <code>section</code>; that’s fine and we’ll address it in a moment so that only one is accessible at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><h1 class=\"scrollDrivenHeading\" aria-hidden=\"true\">Primary Colors</h1></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice that I’ve added <code>aria-hidden=\"true\"</code> to this heading, so it won’t be picked up by screen readers. Now I can add a class specifically for screen readers, <code>.srOnly</code>, to all the other headings. This way, anyone viewing the content “normally” will see only the animated heading, while assistive technology users will get the regular, static semantic headings.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Note:</strong> The style for the <code>.srOnly</code> class is based on <a href=\"https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html\">“Inclusively Hidden”</a> by Scott O’Hara.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"handling-support\">Handling Support</h3>\n\n\n<p>As much as accessibility matters, there’s another concern we need to keep in mind: support. CSS Scroll-Driven Animations are fantastic, but they’re still not fully supported everywhere. That’s why it’s important to provide the static version for browsers that don’t support SDA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to hide the animated heading we just added using <code>display: none</code>. Then, we’ll add a new <code>@supports</code> block to check for SDA support. Inside that block, where SDA is supported, we can change back the display for the heading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>.srOnly</code> class should also move into the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/s/supports/\"><code>@supports</code></a> block, since we only want it to apply when the effect is active, not when it’s not supported. This way, just like with assistive technology, anyone visiting the page in a browser without SDA support will still get the static content.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.scrollDrivenHeading {\n  display: none;\n}\n\n@supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {\n  .scrollDrivenHeading {\n    display: block;\n  }\n  \n  /* Screen Readers Only */\n  .srOnly {\n    clip: rect(0 0 0 0); \n    clip-path: inset(50%);\n    height: 1px;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    position: absolute;\n    white-space: nowrap; \n    width: 1px;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"get-sticky\">Get Sticky</h3>\n\n\n<p>The next thing we need to do is handle the stickiness of the heading. To make sure the heading always stays on screen, we’ll set its <code>position</code> to <code>sticky</code> with <code>top: 0</code> so it sticks to the top of the viewport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we’re at it, let’s add some basic styling, including a background so the text doesn’t blend with whatever’s behind the heading, a bit of <code>padding</code> for spacing, and <code>white-space: nowrap</code> to keep the heading on a single line.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* inside the @supports block */\n.scrollDrivenHeading {\n  display: block;\n  position: sticky;\n  top: 0;\n  background-image: linear-gradient(0deg, transparent, black 1em);\n  padding: 0.5em 0.25em;\n  white-space: nowrap;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now everything’s set up: in normal conditions, we’ll see a single sticky heading at the top of the page. And if someone uses assistive technology or a browser that doesn’t support SDA, they’ll still get the regular static content.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we’re ready to start animating the text. <em>Almost…</em></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-magic-numbers\">The Magic Numbers</h2>\n\n\n<p>To build the text animation, we need to know exactly where the text should change. With SDA, scrolling basically becomes our timeline, and we have to determine the exact points on that timeline to trigger the animation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make this easier, and to help you pinpoint those positions, I’ve prepared the following script:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>@property --scroll-position {\n  syntax: \"\";\n  inherits: false;\n  initial-value: 0;\n}\n\nbody::after {\n  counter-reset: sp var(--scroll-position);\n  content: counter(sp) \"%\";\n  position: fixed;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  padding: 1em;\n  background-color: maroon;\n  animation: scrollPosition steps(100);\n  animation-timeline: scroll();\n}\n\n@keyframes scrollPosition {\n  0% { --scroll-position: 0; }\n  100% { --scroll-position: 100; }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t want to get too deep into this code, but the idea is to take the same scroll timeline we’ll use next to animate the text, and use it to animate a custom property (<code>--scroll-position</code>) from <code>0</code> to <code>100</code> based on the scroll progress, and display that value in the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we’ll add this at the start of our code, we’ll see a small red square in the top-left corner of the screen, showing the current scroll position as a percentage (to match the keyframes). This way, you can scroll to any section you want and easily mark the percentage where each heading should begin.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With this method and a bit of trial and error, I found that I want the headings to change at 30%, 60%, and 90%. So, how do we actually do it? Let’s start animating.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"animating-text\">Animating Text</h3>\n\n\n<p>First, we’ll clear out the content inside the <code>.scrollDrivenHeading</code> element so it’s empty and ready for dynamic content. In the CSS, I’ll add a pseudo-element to the heading, which we’ll use to animate the text. We’ll give it empty <code>content</code>, set up the <code>animation-name</code>, and of course, assign the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation-timeline/\"><code>animation-timeline</code></a> to <code>scroll()</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since I’m animating the <code>content</code> property, which is a discrete type, it doesn’t transition smoothly between values. It just jumps from one to the next. By setting the <code>animation-timing-function</code> property to <code>step-end</code>, I make sure each change happens exactly at the keyframe I define, so the text switches precisely where I want it to, instead of somewhere in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.scrollDrivenHeading {\n  /* style */\n\n  &amp;::after {\n    content: '';\n    animation-name: headingContent;\n    animation-timing-function: step-end;\n    animation-timeline: scroll();\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the keyframes, this part is pretty straightforward (for now). We’ll set the first frame (<code>0%</code>) to the first heading, and assign the other headings to the percentages we found earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>@keyframes headingContent {\n  0% { content: 'Primary Colors'}\n  30% { content: 'Red Power'}\n  60% { content: 'Blue Calm'}\n  90%, 100% { content: 'Yellow Joy'}\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now we’ve got a site with a sticky heading that updates as you scroll.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait, right now it just switches instantly. Where’s the animation?! Here’s where it gets interesting. Since we’re not using JavaScript or any string manipulation, we have to write the keyframes ourselves. The best approach is to start from the target heading you want to reach, and build backwards. So, if you want to animate between the first and second heading, it would look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>@keyframes headingContent {\n  0% { content: 'Primary Colors'}\n  \n  9% { content: 'Primary Color'}\n  10% { content: 'Primary Colo'}\n  11% { content: 'Primary Col'}\n  12% { content: 'Primary Co'}\n  13% { content: 'Primary C'}\n  14% { content: 'Primary '}\n  15% { content: 'Primary'}\n  16% { content: 'Primar'}\n  17% { content: 'Prima'}\n  18% { content: 'Prim'}\n  19% { content: 'Pri'}\n  20% { content: 'Pr'}\n  21% { content: 'P'}\n  \n  22% { content: 'R'}\n  23% { content: 'Re'}\n  24% { content: 'Red'}\n  25% { content: 'Red '}\n  26% { content: 'Red P'}\n  27% { content: 'Red Po'}\n  28%{ content: 'Red Pow'}\n  29% { content: 'Red Powe'}\n  \n  30% { content: 'Red Power'}\n  60% { content: 'Blue Calm'}\n  90%, 100% { content: 'Yellow Joy'}\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I simply went back by 1% each time, removing or adding a letter as needed. Note that in other cases, you might want to use a different step size, and not always 1%. For example, on longer headings with more words, you’ll probably want smaller steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we repeat this process for all the other headings, we’ll end up with a fully animated heading.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"user-preferences\">User Preferences</h3>\n\n\n<p>We talked before about accessibility and making sure the content works well with assistive technology, but there’s one more thing you should keep in mind: <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/m/media/prefers-reduced-motion/\"><code>prefers-reduced-motion</code></a>. Even though this isn’t a strict WCAG requirement for this kind of animation, it can make a big difference for people with vestibular sensitivities, so it’s a good idea to offer a way to show the content without animations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to provide a non-animated alternative, all you need to do is wrap your <code>@supports</code> block with a <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> query:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>@media screen and (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {\n  @supports (animation-timeline: scroll()) {\n    /* style */\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"leveling-up\">Leveling Up</h3>\n\n\n<p>Let’s talk about variations. In the previous example, we animated the entire heading text, but we don’t have to do that. You can animate just the part you want, and use additional animations to enhance the effect and make things more interesting. For example, here I kept the text “Primary Color” fixed, and added a <code>span</code> after it that handles the animated text.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><h1 class=\"scrollDrivenHeading\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n  Primary Color<span></span>\n</h1></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And since I now have a separate <code>span</code>, I can also animate its color to match each value.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next example, I kept the text animation on the <code>span</code>, but instead of changing the text color, I added another scroll-driven animation on the heading itself to change its background color. This way, you can add as many animations as you want and change whatever you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"your-turn-\">Your Turn!</h2>\n\n\n<p>CSS Scroll-Driven Animations are more than just a cool trick; they’re a game-changer that opens the door to a whole new world of web design. With just a bit of creativity, you can turn even the most ordinary pages into something interactive, memorable, and truly engaging. The possibilities really are endless, from subtle effects that enhance the user experience, to wild, animated transitions that make your site stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what would you build with scroll-driven animations? What would you create with this new superpower? Try it out, experiment, and if you come up with something cool, have some ideas, wild experiments, or even weird failures, I’d love to hear about them. I’m always excited to see what others come up with, so feel free to share your work, questions, or feedback below.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/itscrisdiaz.com\">Cristian Díaz</a> for reviewing the examples, making sure everything is accessible, and contributing valuable advice and improvements.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/scroll-driven-sticky-heading/\">Scroll-Driven Sticky Heading</a> originally published on <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=css-tricks.com&amp;utm_campaign=family_&amp;utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

필수적입니다. 하지만 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">모든 AI/ML 작업이 항상 고성능, 고용량 GPU를 요구하는 것은 아닌데요.</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 간단한 실험이나 PoC(Proof of Concept) 단계에서는 작은 모델로 충분한 경우가 많으며, 서비스 운영 단계에서도 작은 모델을 사용하는 경우가 흔합니다. 예를 들어 실시간 번역 서비스의 경우, 빠른 응답을 위해 처음부터 작은 모델을 학습시키거나 이미 훈련된 모델을 양자화(Quantization)하여 모델의 크기를 줄이는 전략을 활용합니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"225a360d-33e3-8053-945f-d4101bdd14f0\"

class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">이러한 작은 모델들이 고성능·고용량 GPU(예: H100)에 배치될 경우 GPU 메모리를 충분히 활용하지 못하고 낭비하게 됩니다. </span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">특히 작은 모델들도 응답 시간이 중요한 서비스에 활용될 때는 빠른 처리 속도가 필수적이기 때문에, </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">고성능 GPU를 완전히 배제할 수는 없습니다</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">. </span></span></span></p><p id=\"22ca360d-33e3-80cc-9bea-c86c654e1542\"

class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">토스증권처럼 다양한 서비스를 빠르게 출시하고 지속적으로 테스트하는 환경에서는 이런 자원 낭비가 더 빈번하게 발생할 수 있습니다. 데이터 분석 결과, 전체 워크로드의 약 1/3은 GPU 자원을 1/4조차 활용하지 않고 있었습니다. 물론 이는 서비스 개발 주기나 비즈니스 상황에 따라 다를 수 있습니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"225a360d-33e3-809c-80f1-dbec2f87ab3c\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"></span></span></p><aside

의미합니다. 즉, 고성능일 수록 모델 추론 시간이 줄어들게 됩니다. ‘고용량’은 GPU 메모리가 큰 경우를 뜻합니다. </span></span></span></h4></aside><p id=\"225a360d-33e3-8086-95de-c1e33a3e7dbc\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span

class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">이러한 낭비는 비용 측면에서도 심각한 문제입니다. 예를 들어 AWS 기준으로 H100 GPU 한 장의 하루 대여 비용은 약 38만 원(환율 1300원 기준)입니다. 이 GPU를 단지 1/4만 활용한다면 하루 약 28만 원의 손실이 발생하고, 월 단위(30일 기준)로 환산하면 약 855만 원의 비용이 낭비됩니다. 서버 한 대에 GPU가 8장 있다고 가정하면 단순 계산상 서버 당 월 6,840만 원이라는 상당한 손실이 생기게 되죠.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"225a360d-33e3-805b-8772-ddc8200a59e1\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span

엔지니어들에게 GPU 클러스터 운영은 식당 운영과 비슷합니다. 식당이 최대한 많은 손님을 받아 최대의 이윤을 내기 위해 빈 테이블을 최소화하듯, GPU 클러스터 역시 최대한 많은 태스크를 효율적으로 배치하여 GPU 자원의 낭비를 최소화하는 것이 핵심입니다.</span></span></span></p><p

class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">이러한 문제를 어떻게 해결해볼수있을까요?</span></span></span></p><p id=\"225a360d-33e3-8067-8b76-cd49d53ba58b\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">GPU 자원의 낭비를 최소화하기 위해서는 결국 태스크에 맞는 GPU를 제공해야 합니다. 이러한 환경을 제공하기 위해서는 보통 세 가지의 선택지가 있습니다. 첫 번째는 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">클라우드를 활용하는 방법</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">이며, 두 번째는 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">다양한 GPU를 혼합하여 운용하는 방법</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">, 마지막으로는 Nvidia에서 제공하는 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">GPU 가상화 기술(MPS, MIG 등)을 활용하는 방법</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">입니다. 각 방법의 장단점을 차례로 살펴보겠습니다.</span></span></span></p><p

class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">클라우드를 활용한 GPU 운영은 빠르고 유연한 자원 확장성이라는 측면에서 큰 장점이 있습니다. 필요할 때만 자원을 할당받아 사용할 수 있어 초기 자본 투자 없이 다양한 실험을 빠르게 시도해볼 수 있습니다. 특히 PoC 단계나 일시적인 고부하 테스트에는 적합한 방식입니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"225a360d-33e3-80b4-af82-d07e37a8d301\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">하지만 단점도 분명합니다. 첫째, 워크로드가 장기적이고 지속적인 경우 및 자체 클러스터가 구축된 환경에서는 오히려 비용이 더 발생할 수 있습니다. 둘째, </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">데이터 보안 및 컴플라이언스 문제</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">로 인해 민감한 데이터를 다루는 환경에서는 사용이 제한되거나 별도의 보안 설계가 필요합니다. 셋째, 클라우드 환경에서 GPU 인스턴스를 원하는 방식으로 정밀하게 제어하거나 커스터마이징하기 어렵고, 지역별 가용성 이슈로 인해 자원을 확보하지 못하는 경우도 발생할 수 있습니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"225a360d-33e3-8090-8b5c-dbb0763df76b\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-1iisb9p\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">결론적으로, </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">소규모 조직이나 단발성 실험 위주의 환경</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">에서는 클라우드가 비용과 유연성 측면에서 효과적인 선택이 될 수 있습니다. 그러나 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">자체 IDC를 운용하며 일정 수준 이상의 지속적 워크로드를 보유한 조직</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">에서는 클라우드가 반드시 저렴하지 않으며, </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">온프레미스 환경이 더 안정적이고 비용 효율적인 대안이 될 수 있습니다.</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 또한, 금융·헬스케어 등 엄격한 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">컴플라이언스 요건</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">이 있는 산업군에서는 클라우드 사용에 법적·보안적 제약이 뒤따를 수 있어, </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">온프레미스 환경이 정책적 측면에서도 유리할 수 있습니다.</span></span></span></p><h2 id=\"225a360d-33e3-80ec-b15a-ff129ca97c31\" class=\"css-1c1qox8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span class=\"css-p4abj2\"><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">방법2. 혼합 GPU

용량이 서로 다른 GPU를 함께 구성해 사용하는 방식을 말합니다. 가장 큰 장점은 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">작업 특성에 따라 적절한 GPU를 유연하게 할당할 수 있다는 점</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">입니다. 예를 들어, 경량 모델에는 저용량 GPU를, 대규모 학습이나 배치 추론처럼 메모리를 많이 요구하는 작업에는 고용량 GPU를 배정함으로써 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">비용 효율성을 높일 수 있습니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"225a360d-33e3-8065-a36c-f2df357106fd\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span

class=\"css-q3ktjb\">운영 정책이 복잡해지고 관리 부담이 커질 수 있습니다.</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 예를 들어, Hopper 세대에는 저용량 GPU가 없어 L40이나 A40 같은 이전 세대 GPU를 함께 써야 하는데, 이 경우 드라이버, CUDA 버전, 프레임워크 호환성 등이 달라져 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">통합 관리가 어려워집니다.</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 또한 GPU 간 메모리 차이에 따라 스케줄링 정책도 세밀하게 설계해야 하므로 운영 복잡도가 높아집니다.</span></span></span></p><p

어렵고 자원 낭비로 이어질 수 있습니다.</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\"> 시간이 지날수록 고용량 GPU에 대한 수요가 집중되면 저용량 GPU는 점점 활용도가 낮아지고 결국 유휴 자원이 될 수 있습니다. </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">초기에는 비용 절감을 기대하고 도입한 저용량 GPU가 오히려 방치되며 비효율을 초래하는 역설적인 상황</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">이 발생할 수 있습니다.</span></span></span></p><p id=\"225a360d-33e3-80b5-ab19-c4ec8d5f2811\" class=\"css-14on8x8\"><span class=\"css-1r3ko7u\"><span

    "title": "Better CSS Shapes Using shape() — Part 4: Close and Move",
    "content": "\n<p>This is the fourth post in a series about the new CSS <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/shape/\"><code>shape()</code></a> function. So far, we’ve covered the most common commands you will use to draw various shapes, including lines, arcs, and curves. This time, I want to introduce you to two more commands: <code>close</code> and <code>move</code>. They’re fairly simple in practice, and I think you will rarely use them, but they are incredibly useful when you need them.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387613\"></span>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group ticss-ad1a3c1b\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"better-css-shapes-using-shape\">Better CSS Shapes Using <code>shape()</code></h4>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">Lines and Arcs</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-2-more-on-arcs/\">More on&nbsp;Arcs</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-3-curves/\">Curves</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Close and Move (you are here!)</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-close-command\">The <code>close</code> command</h3>\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">the first part</a>, we said that <code>shape()</code> always starts with a <code>from</code> command to define the first starting point but what about the end? It should end with a <code>close</code> command.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>But you never used any <code>close</code> command in the previous articles!?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s true. I never did because I either “close” the shape myself or rely on the browser to “close” it for me. Said like that, it’s a bit confusing, but let’s take a simple example to better understand:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>clip-path: shape(from 0 0, line to 100% 0, line to 100% 100%) </code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If you try this code, you will get a triangle shape, but if you look closely, you will notice that we have only two line commands whereas, to draw a triangle, we need a total of three lines. The last line between <code>100% 100%</code> and <code>0 0</code> is implicit, and that’s the part where the browser is closing the shape for me without having to explicitly use a <code>close</code> command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could have written the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>clip-path: shape(from 0 0, line to 100% 0, line to 100% 100%, close)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Or instead, define the last line by myself:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>clip-path: shape(from 0 0, line to 100% 0, line to 100% 100%, line to 0 0)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But since the browser is able to close the shape alone, there is no need to add that last <code>line</code> command nor do we need to explicitly add the <code>close</code> command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might lead you to think that the <code>close</code> command is useless, right? It’s true in most cases (after all, I have written three articles about <code>shape()</code> without using it), but it’s important to know about it and what it does. In some particular cases, it can be useful, especially if used in the middle of a shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, my starting point is the center and the logic of the shape is to draw four triangles. In the process, I need to get back to the center each time. So, instead of writing <code>line to center</code>, I simply write <code>close</code> and the browser will automatically get back to the initial point!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intuitively, we should write the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>clip-path: shape( \n  from center, \n  line to 20%  0,   hline by 60%, line to center, /* triangle 1 */\n  line to 100% 20%, vline by 60%, line to center, /* triangle 2 */\n  line to 20% 100%, hline by 60%, line to center, /* triangle 3 */\n  line to 0   20%,  vline by 60% /* triangle 4 */\n)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But we can optimize it a little and simply do this instead:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>clip-path: shape( \n  from center, \n  line to 20%  0,   hline by 60%, close,\n  line to 100% 20%, vline by 60%, close,\n  line to 20% 100%, hline by 60%, close,\n  line to 0    20%, vline by 60%\n)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We write less code, sure, but another important thing is that if I update the <code>center</code> value with another position, <strong>the</strong> <code>close</code> <strong>command will follow that position</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t forget about this trick. It can help you optimize a lot of shapes by writing less code.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-move-command\">The <code>move</code> command</h3>\n\n\n<p>Let’s turn our attention to another <code>shape()</code> command you may rarely use, but can be incredibly useful in certain situations: the <code>move</code> command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most times when we need to draw a shape, it’s actually <em>one continuous shape</em>. But it may happen that our shape is composed of different parts not linked together. In these situations, the <code>move</code> command is what you will need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take an example, similar to the previous one, but this time the triangles don’t touch each other:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Intuitively, we may think we need four separate elements, with its own <code>shape()</code> definition. But the that example is a single shape!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trick is to draw the first triangle, then “move” somewhere else to draw the next one, and so on. The <code>move</code> command is similar to the <code>from</code> command but we use it in the middle of <code>shape()</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>clip-path: shape(\n  from    50% 40%, line to 20%  0,   hline by 60%, close, /* triangle 1 */\n  move to 60% 50%, line to 100% 20%, vline by 60%, close, /* triangle 2 */\n  move to 50% 60%, line to 20% 100%, hline by 60%, close, /* triangle 3 */\n  move to 40% 50%, line to 0   20%,  vline by 60% /* triangle 4 */\n)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After drawing the first triangle, we “close” it and “move” to a new point to draw the next triangle. We can have multiple shapes using a single <code>shape()</code> definition. A more generic code will look like the below:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>clip-path: shape(\n  from    X1 Y1, ..., close, /* shape 1 */\n  move to X2 Y2, ..., close, /* shape 2 */\n  ...\n  move to Xn Yn, ... /* shape N */\n)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>close</code> commands before the <code>move</code> commands aren’t mandatory, so the code can be simplified to this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>clip-path: shape(\n  from    X1 Y1, ..., /* shape 1 */\n  move to X2 Y2, ..., /* shape 2 */\n  ...\n  move to Xn Yn, ... /* shape N */\n)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at a few interesting use cases where this technique can be helpful.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cut-out-shapes\">Cut-out shapes</h4>\n\n\n<p>Previously, I shared a trick on <a href=\"https://css-tip.com/cut-out-shapes/\">how to create cut-out shapes</a> using <code>clip-path: polygon()</code>. Starting from any kind of polygon, we can easily invert it to get its cut-out version:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We can do the same using <code>shape()</code>. The idea is to have an intersection between the main shape and the rectangle shape that fits the element boundaries. We need two shapes, hence the need for the <code>move</code> command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.shape {\n  clip-path: shape(from ...., move to 0 0, hline to 100%, vline to 100%, hline to 0);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>You start by creating your main shape and then you “move” to <code>0 0</code> and you create the rectangle shape (Remember, It’s the first shape we create in <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/#aa-rectangle\">the first part of this series</a>). We can even go further and introduce a CSS variable to easily switch between the normal shape and the inverted one.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.shape {\n  clip-path: shape(from .... var(--i,));\n}\n.invert {\n  --i:,move to 0 0, hline to 100%, vline to 100%, hline to 0;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, <code>--i</code> is not defined so <code>var(--i,)</code>will be empty and we get the main shape. If we define the variable with the rectangle shape, we get the inverted version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is an example using a rounded hexagon shape:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, the code should be as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.shape {\n  clip-path: shape(evenodd from .... var(--i,));\n}\n.invert {\n  --i:,move to 0 0, hline to 100%, vline to 100%, hline to 0;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice the <code>evenodd</code> I am adding at the beginning of <code>shape()</code>. I won’t bother you with a detailed explanation on what it does but in some cases, the inverted shape is not visible and the fix is to add <code>evenodd</code> at the beginning. You can check <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/fill-rule\">the MDN page for more details</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another improvement we can do is to add a variable to control the space around the shape. Let’s suppose you want to make the hexagon shape of the previous example smaller. It‘s tedious to update the code of the hexagon but it’s easier to update the code of the rectangle shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.shape {\n  clip-path: shape(evenodd from ... var(--i,)) content-box;\n}\n.invert {\n  --d: 20px;\n  padding: var(--d);\n  --i: ,move to calc(-1*var(--d)) calc(-1*var(--d)),\n        hline to calc(100% + var(--d)),\n        vline to calc(100% + var(--d)),\n        hline to calc(-1*var(--d));\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We first update the reference box of the shape to be <code>content-box</code>. Then we add some padding which will logically reduce the area of the shape since it will no longer include the padding (nor the border). The padding is excluded (invisible) by default and here comes the trick where we update the rectangle shape to re-include the padding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why the <code>--i</code> variable is so verbose. It uses the value of the padding to extend the rectangle area and cover the whole element as if we didn’t have <code>content-box</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only you can easily invert any kind of shape, but you can also control the space around it! Here is another demo using the CSS-Tricks logo to illustrate how easy the method is:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This exact same example is available in my <a href=\"https://css-generators.com/svg-to-css/\">SVG-to-CSS converter</a>, providing you with the <code>shape()</code> code without having to do all of the math.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"repetitive-shapes\">Repetitive shapes</h4>\n\n\n<p>Another interesting use case of the <code>move</code> command is when we need to repeat the same shape multiple times. Do you remember the difference between the <code>by</code> and the <code>to</code> directives? The <code>by</code> directive allows us to define relative coordinates considering the previous point. So, if we create our shape using only <code>by</code>, we can easily reuse the same code as many times as we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with a simple example of a circle shape:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>clip-path: shape(from X Y, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting from <code>X Y</code>, I draw a first arc moving upward by <code>50px</code>, then I get back to <code>X Y</code> with another arc using the same offset, but downward. If you are a bit lost with the syntax, try reviewing <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">Part 1</a> to refresh your memory about the <code>arc</code> command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How I drew the shape is not important. What is important is that whatever the value of <code>X Y</code> is, I will always get the same circle but in a different position. Do you see where I am going with this idea? If I want to add another circle, I simply repeat the same code with a different <code>X Y</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>clip-path: shape(\n  from    X1 Y1, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%,\n  move to X2 Y2, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%\n)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And since the code is the same, I can store the circle shape into a CSS variable and draw as many circles as I want:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.shape {\n  --sh:, arc by 0 -50px of 1%, arc by 0 50px of 1%;\n  \n  clip-path: shape(\n    from    X1 Y1 var(--sh),\n    move to X2 Y2 var(--sh),\n    ... \n    move to Xn Yn var(--sh)\n  ) \n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t want a circle? Easy, you can update the <code>--sh</code> variable with any shape you want. Here is an example with three different shapes:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And guess what? You can invert the whole thing using the cut-out technique by adding the rectangle shape at the end:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This code is a perfect example of the <code>shape()</code> function’s power. We don’t have any code duplication and we can simply adjust the shape with CSS variables. This is something we are unable to achieve with the <code>path()</code> function because it doesn’t support variables.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n<p>That’s all for this fourth installment of our series on the CSS <code>shape()</code> function! We didn’t make any super complex shapes, but we learned how two simple commands can open a lot of possibilities of what can be done using <code>shape()</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just for fun, here is one more demo recreating a classic <a href=\"https://css-tip.com/dots-loader/\">three-dot loader</a> using the last technique we covered. Notice how much further we could go, adding things like animation to the mix:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group ticss-ad1a3c1b\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"better-css-shapes-using-shape\">Better CSS Shapes Using <code>shape()</code></h4>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">Lines and Arcs</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-2-more-on-arcs/\">More on&nbsp;Arcs</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-3-curves/\">Curves</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Close and Move (you are here!)</li>\n</ol>\n</div></div>\n<hr>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-4-close-and-move/\">Better CSS Shapes Using shape() — Part 4: Close and Move</a> originally published on <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=css-tricks.com&amp;utm_campaign=family_&amp;utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

    "title": "The Gap Strikes Back: Now Stylable",
    "content": "\n<p>Four years ago, I wrote an article titled <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/minding-the-gap/\">Minding the “gap”</a>, where I talked about the CSS <code>gap</code> property, where it applied, and how it worked with various CSS layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, I described how easy it was to evenly space items out in a flex, grid, or multi-column layout, by using the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/g/gap/\">gap</a></code> property. But, I also said that <em>styling</em> the gap areas was much harder, and I shared a workaround.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, workarounds like using extra HTML elements, pseudo-elements, or borders to draw separator lines tend to come with drawbacks, especially those that impact your layout size, interfere with assistive technologies, or pollute your markup with style-only elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I’m writing again about layout gaps, but this time, to tell you all about a new and exciting CSS feature that’s going to change it all. <strong>What you previously had to use workarounds for, you’ll soon be able to do with just a few simple CSS properties that make it easy, yet also flexible, to display styled separators between your layout items.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s already a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-gaps-1/\">specification draft for the feature</a> you can peruse. At the time I’m writing this, it is available in Chrome and Edge 139 behind a flag. But I believe it won’t be long before we turn that flag on. I believe other browsers are also very receptive and engaged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Displaying decorative lines between items of a layout can make a big difference. When used well, these lines can bring more structure to your layout, and give your users more of a sense of how the different regions of a page are organized.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387471\"></span>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"introducing-css-gap-decorations\">Introducing CSS gap decorations</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever used a multi-column layout, such as by using the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/column-width/\">column-width</a></code> property, then you might already be familiar with gap decorations. You can draw vertical lines between the columns of a multi-column layout by using the <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/column-rule/\">column-rule</a></code> property:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>article {\n  column-width: 20rem;\n  column-rule: 1px solid black;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-1.webp?resize=1254%2C383&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Two 1-pixel solid black vertical lines separate a row of three text blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-387557\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-1.webp?w=1254&amp;ssl=1 1254w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-1.webp?resize=300%2C92&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-1.webp?resize=1024%2C313&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-1.webp?resize=768%2C235&amp;ssl=1 768w\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The CSS gap decorations feature builds on this to provide a more comprehensive system that makes it easy for you to draw separator lines in other layout types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the draft specification says that the <code>column-rule</code> property also works in flexbox and grid layouts:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.my-grid-container {\n  display: grid;\n  gap: 2px;\n  column-rule: 2px solid pink;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-2.webp?resize=1217%2C436&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"A 2-pixel solid light pink vertical line separates two side-by-side text blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-387558\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-2.webp?w=1217&amp;ssl=1 1217w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-2.webp?resize=300%2C107&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-2.webp?resize=1024%2C367&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-2.webp?resize=768%2C275&amp;ssl=1 768w\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No need for extra elements or borders! The key benefit here is that the decoration happens in CSS only, where it belongs, with no impacts to your semantic markup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CSS gap decorations feature also introduces a new <code>row-rule</code> property for drawing lines between rows:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.my-flex-container {\n  display: flex;\n  gap: 10px;\n  row-rule: 10px dotted limegreen;\n  column-rule: 5px dashed coral;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=1375%2C205&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Six items flowing horizontally in two rows in a flex container, separated by 5-pixel dashed coral-colored vertical lines and a single 10-pixel dotted lime-green line between the two rows.\" class=\"wp-image-387559\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?w=1375&amp;ssl=1 1375w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=300%2C45&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=1024%2C153&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-3.webp?resize=768%2C115&amp;ssl=1 768w\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But that’s not all, because the above syntax also allows you to define multiple, comma-separated, line style values, and use the same <code>repeat()</code> function that CSS grid already uses for row and column templates. This makes it possible to define different styles of line decorations in a single layout, and adapt to an unknown number of gaps:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.my-container {\n  display: grid;\n  gap: 2px;\n  row-rule:\n    repeat(2, 1px dashed red),\n    2px solid black,\n    repeat(auto, 1px dotted green);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-snippet-4.svg\" alt=\"Seven text blocks stacked vertically separated by horizontal lines that are styled differently.\" class=\"wp-image-387560\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the CSS gap decorations feature comes with additional CSS properties such as <code>row-rule-break</code>, <code>column-rule-break</code>, <code>row-rule-outset</code>, <code>column-rule-outset</code>, and <code>gap-rule-paint-order</code>, which make it possible to precisely customize the way the separators are drawn, whether they overlap, or where they start and end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, all of this works across <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/\">grid</a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\">flexbox</a>, <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/revisiting-css-multi-column-layout/\">multi-column</a>, and soon, <a href=\"https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2025/05/21/masonry-item-flow-and-gulp/\">masonry</a>!</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"browser-support\">Browser support</h3>\n\n\n<p>Currently, the CSS gap decorations feature is only available in Chromium-based browsers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature is still early in the making, and there’s time for you all to try it and to provide feedback that could help make the feature better and more adapted to your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to try the feature today, make sure to use Edge or Chrome, starting with version 139 (or another Chromium-based browser that matches those versions), and enable the flag by following these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>In Chrome or Edge, go to <code>about://flags</code>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the search field, search for <strong>Enable Experimental Web Platform Features</strong>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enable the flag.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Restart the browser.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To put this all into practice, let’s walk through an example together that uses the new CSS gap decorations feature. <a href=\"https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/css-gap-decorations/personal-site.html\">I also have a final example you can demo.</a></p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"using-css-gap-decorations\">Using CSS gap decorations</h3>\n\n\n<p>Let’s build a simple web page to learn how to use the feature. Here is what we’ll be building:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-01.svg\" alt=\"Webpage titled My Personal Site in the header above a horizontal navigation and a staggered, masonry-like layout of text and images with thin lines between them. The design is in black and white.\" class=\"wp-image-387486\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The above layout contains a header section with a title, a navigation menu with a few links, a main section with a series of short paragraphs of text and photos, and a footer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll use the following markup:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code>\n<header>\n  <h1>My personal site</h1>\n</header>\n<nav>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a>Home</a></li>\n    <li><a>Blog</a></li>\n    <li><a>About</a></li>\n    <li><a>Links</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</nav>\n<main>\n  <article>\n    <p>...</p>\n  </article>\n  <article>\n    <img alt=\"A sleeping cat.\">\n  </article>\n  <article>\n    <p>...</p>\n  </article>\n  <article>\n    <img alt=\"An old olive tree trunk.\">\n  </article>\n  <article>\n    <p>...</p>\n  </article>\n  <article>\n    <p>...</p>\n  </article>\n  <article>\n    <p>...</p>\n  </article>\n  <article>\n    <img alt=\"Snow flakes falling in a motion blur effect.\">\n  </article>\n</main>\n<footer>\n  <p>© 2025 Patrick Brosset</p>\n</footer>\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll start by making the <code></code> element be a grid container. This way, we can space out the <code></code></p><header>, <code></code><nav><code></code>, <code></code><main><code></code>, and <code></code><footer><code></code> elements apart in one go by using the <code>gap</code> property:<p></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>body {\n  display: grid;\n  gap: 4rem;\n  margin: 2rem;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s now use the CSS gap decorations feature to display horizontal separator lines within the gaps we just defined:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>body {\n  display: grid;\n  gap: 4rem;\n  margin: 2rem;\n \n  row-rule: 1rem solid #efefef;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives us the following result:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-02.svg\" alt=\"The basic layout for the webpage. The title is the same but the navigation and layout are both vertically stacked. There are no lines between items in the layout.\" class=\"wp-image-387487\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We can do a bit better by making the first horizontal line look different than the other two lines, and simplify the <code>row-rule</code> value by using the <code>repeat()</code> syntax:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>body {\n  display: grid;\n  gap: 4rem;\n  margin: 2rem;\n \n  row-rule:\n    1rem solid #efefef,\n    repeat(2, 2px solid #efefef);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>With this new <code>row-rule</code> property value, we’re telling the browser to draw the first horizontal separator as a <code>1rem</code> thick line, and the next two separators as <code>2px</code> thick lines, which gives the following result:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-03.svg\" alt=\"The webpage is largely the same, but the border between the site title and the navigation is much thicker.\" class=\"wp-image-387488\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let’s turn our attention to the navigation element and its list of links. We’ll use flexbox to display the links in a single row, where each link is separated from the other links by a gap and a vertical line:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>nav ul {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  gap: 2rem;\n  column-rule: 2px dashed #666;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Very similarly to how we used the <code>row-rule</code> property before, we’re now using the <code>column-rule</code> property to display a dashed <code>2px</code> thick separator between the links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our example web page now looks like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=1552%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"The webpage is still largely the same, but now the navigation is horizontal and there is a light dashed line between the links.\" class=\"wp-image-387482\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?w=1552&amp;ssl=1 1552w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=291%2C300&amp;ssl=1 291w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=993%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 993w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=768%2C792&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-04.webp?resize=1490%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1490w\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The last thing we need to change is the <code></code></p><main> element and its paragraphs and pictures. We’ll use flexbox again and display the various children in a wrapping row of varying width items:<p></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>main {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  gap: 4rem;\n}\n\n\nmain &gt; * {\n  flex: 1 1 200px;\n}\n\n\nmain article:has(p) {\n  flex-basis: 400px;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code snippet, we’re setting the <code></code></p><main> element to be a wrapping flex container with a <code>4rem</code> gap between items and flex lines. We’re also making the items have a flex basis size of <code>200px</code> for pictures and <code>400px</code> for text, and allowing them to grow and shrink as needed. This gives us the following result:<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img src=\"https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-05.svg\" alt=\"The webpage layout has been established but there are no lines between items.\" class=\"wp-image-387489\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s use CSS gap decorations to bring a little more structure to our layout by drawing <code>2px</code> thick separator lines between the rows and columns of the layout:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>main {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  gap: 4rem;\n  row-rule: 2px solid #999;\n  column-rule: 2px solid #999;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This gives us the following result, which is very close to our expected design:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-06.webp?resize=1500%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Thin light lines have been added between the layout of text and images, creating a masonry-like layout.

We don’t want them to span across the entire height of the flex lines but instead start and stop where the content starts and stops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With CSS gap decorations, we can easily achieve this by using the <code>column-rule-outset</code> property to fine-tune exactly where the decorations start and end, relative to the gap area:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>main {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  gap: 4rem;\n  row-rule: 2px solid #999;\n  column-rule: 2px solid #999;\n  column-rule-outset: 0;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>column-rule-outset</code> property above makes the vertical column separators span the height of each row, excluding the gap area, which is what we want:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-07.webp?resize=1495%2C1600&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Spacing has been added between the layout items so that the lines between them are no longer connected, creating an elegant layout.\" class=\"wp-image-387480\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-07.webp?w=1495&amp;ssl=1 1495w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-07.webp?resize=280%2C300&amp;ssl=1 280w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-07.webp?resize=957%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 957w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-07.webp?resize=768%2C822&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gap-decoration-07.webp?resize=1435%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1435w\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, we’re done with our example.

In particular, whether they are made of multiple segments, which start and end at intersections, or single, continuous lines.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the feature is new, there isn’t MDN documentation about it yet.

BotID는 사용자와 봇의 환경을 분석해서 구별할 수 있도록 만들어졌고 Kasada 탐지 엔진을 사용하여 심층 분석을 통해 복을 탐지해서 보이지 않는 Captcha 역할을 한다.(영어)<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>그 밖의 개발 관련</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/augmented-coding-beyond-the-vibes\">Augmented Coding: Beyond the Vibes</a></strong> : Kent Beck이 바이브 코딩은 코드에는 신경쓰지 않고 시스템의 동작에만 신경쓰는 반면 증강 코딩은 코드와 복잡성, 테스트 커버리지 등을 신경쓰면서 AI 코딩하는 것이 다르다고 정의하며 증강 코딩의 강력함을 느껴가면서 이전에 못했던 프로젝트를 다시 시도해 본 결과를 설명한다. Rust로 작성해 보려고 했지만 잘 안되자 Python으로 작성하게 한뒤 이를 바탕으로 다시 Rust로 작성해서 결과를 얻어내고 이때 사용했던 프롬프트도 같이 올려두었다. Kent Beck은 이 직업이 끝나거나 코드를 짜는 즐거움을 잃는 것에 두려움이 많지만 증강 코딩도 여전히 프로그래밍이고 지루한 결정을 줄이고 더 많은 프로그래밍 결정을 할 수 있어서 어떤 면에서는 더 나은 프로그래밍이라고 얘기한다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/developers/introducing-gemini-cli-open-source-ai-agent/\">Gemini CLI: your open-source AI agent</a></strong> : AI 코딩 어시스트인 Gemini Code Assist와 통합된 Gemini CLI를 Google이 오픈소스로 공개했다. Gemini CLI를 통해 터미널에서 파일을 수정하거나 명령을 실행할 수 있고 무료로도 사용할 수 있는데 프리뷰 기간 동안에는 분당 60개, 하루 1,000개의 모델 요청을 무료로 제공한다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/2025-06-24-announcing-sandboxes/\">Run AI-generated code on-demand with Code Sandboxes</a></strong> : Cloudflare에서 LLM 기반의 코드가 안전하게 실행할 수 있도록 컨테이너에서 코드를 실행해 볼 수 있는 <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/sandbox\">Sandbox</a>를 공개했다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://2025.stateofdevs.com/en-US\">The State of Devs 2025</a></strong> : 8천여 명이 설문에 참여한 전 세계 개발자들에 대한 리포트가 공개되었다. 개발자들이 사용하는 앱이나 OS, 수면 품질, 직업 만족도나 취미 등의 통계를 볼 수 있다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://x.com/sam_brannen/status/1937108032573559268\">JUnit 5 renamed to JUnit Framework</a></strong> : Java 테스트 프레임워크인 JUnit 5가 JUnit Framework로 이름을 변경했다.(영어)<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>인프라 관련</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/@tony.infisical/ssh-keys-dont-scale-ssh-certificates-do-268d594b99ba\">SSH Keys Don’t Scale. SSH Certificates Do.</a></strong> : Infisical의 Infisical SSH의 홍보글이긴 한데 SSH 키를 이용해서 보통 서버에 접속하는데 이경우 서버에 <code>known_hosts</code>에 등록도 해야하고 공개키를 매번 서버에 등록해야 하기에 확장성이 좋지 않고 관리하기도 쉽지 않다. SSH 인증서 방식을 쓰면 서버에 <code>@cert-authority</code>로 CA의 공캐키를 받아오도록 설정할 수 있고 사용자는 CA에 인증후 단기 인증서를 받아서 서버에 접속할 수 있기 때문에 보안에도 좋으면서 관리도 더 쉽게 할 수 있어서 SSH 인증서 방식을 쓰는게 좋다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/containers-are-available-in-public-beta-for-simple-global-and-programmable/\">Containers are available in public beta for simple, global, and programmable compute</a></strong> : Cloudflare에서 컨테이너를 실행해서 언어나 환경의 제약 없이 사용할 수 있는 Cloudflare Container가 유료 사용자에게 베타로 공개되었다. Worker를 사용하듯이 쉽게 Container에 배포하고 사용할 수 있다.(영어)<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>AI 관련</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://toss.tech/article/tosspayments-mcp\">토스페이먼츠 결제 시스템 연동을 돕는 MCP 서버 구현기</a></strong> : 토스페이먼츠에서 MCP 서버를 만든 과정을 설명한다. 사용자들이 결제 시스템 연동을 더 쉽게 하기 위해 MCP를 로컬 기반으로 제공하기로 하고 기존 문서를 이용해서 <code>llms.txt</code>로 만들었으나 결과가 만족스럽지 않았다. 그래서 BM25를 이용해서 청크로 나눈 문서를 찾아서 훨씬 더 정확한 응답을 할 수 있게 되었다.(한국어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n-developer-guide/\">Introducing Gemma 3n: The developer guide</a></strong> : Google의 경량 모델인 Gemma의 새 버전인 Gemma 3n이 출시되었다. 멀티모달을 지원하며 온디바이스에 최적화되고도 좋은 성능을 보여주고 있다.(영어)<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>볼만한 링크</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.programmax.net/articles/png-is-back/\">PNG is back!</a></strong> : 20년 만에 PNG 이미지 형식의 새로운 스펙이 공개되고 여러 곳에서 PNG를 추천하며 20년간 멈춰있던 과거의 영광을 되찾았다. 새로운 스펠에서는 HDR, 애니메이션, Exif를 지원하게 되었다.(영어)<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>IT 업계 뉴스</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-cloud-donates-a2a-to-linux-foundation/\">Google Cloud donates A2A to Linux Foundation</a></strong> : Google이 에이전트간 통신 프로토콜인 A2A를 Linux Foundation에 기부하고 AWS, Cisco, Microsoft, Salesforce, SAP, Service Now와 함께 Linux 재단 아래 프로젝트를 설립했다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle4\">JavaScript™ Trademark Update</a></strong> : Deno가 Oracle이 가진 JavaScript 상표권에 대한 권리를 취소하기 위해 진행하는 사기 소송을 미국 상표심판부에서 기각했다. 하지만, 이 사기 소송이 사건의 핵심은 아니었기에 사기 청구를 더 수정하지 않고 소송을 계속 진행할 예정이며 Oracle은 8월 7일까지 취소 청원에 대한 답변을 보내야 한다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.aitimes.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=200100\">앤트로픽이 AI 저작권 소송에서 이길 수 있었던 방법은 '중고책 구입'</a></strong> : Anthropic이 AI 학습에 저작권자 허락없이 도서를 이용한 것은 합법이라는 미국 법원 판결이 나왔다. 이는 저작권물에 대해 AI 업계가 공정 사용이라는 주장을 뒷받침하는 판결인데 몇달전의 판결과는 반대로 나온 이 판결의 판결문을 보면 Anthropic의 사건의 경우 수백만달러를 드려 중고 책을 구매해서 학습에 사용했다는 점이 주요하게 작용했다.(한국어)<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>프로젝트</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action\">Claude Code Action</a></strong> : GitHub 이슈나 PR에서 Claude Code를 사용할 수

    "title": "Using CSS Cascade Layers With Tailwind Utilities",
    "content": "\n<p>Adam Wathan has (very cleverly) built Tailwind with <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/\">CSS Cascade Layers</a>, making it extremely powerful for organizing styles by priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>@layer theme, base, components, utilities;\n@import 'tailwindcss/theme.css' layer(theme);\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities.css' layer(utilities);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The core of Tailwind are its utilities. This means you have two choices:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The default choice</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The unorthodox choice</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-386907\"></span>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-default-choice\">The default choice</h3>\n\n\n<p>The default choice is to follow Tailwind’s recommended layer order: place components first, and Tailwind utilities last.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you’re building components, you need to manually wrap your components with a <code>@layer</code> directive. Then, overwrite your component styles with Tailwind, putting Tailwind as the “most important layer”.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* Write your components */\n@layer components {\n  .component {\n    /* Your CSS here */\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code> \n<div class=\"component p-4\"> ... </div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a decent way of doing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, being the bad boy I am, I don’t take the default approach as the “best” one. Over a year of (major) experimentation with Tailwind and vanilla CSS, I’ve come across what I believe is a better solution.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"the-unorthodox-choice\">The Unorthodox Choice</h3>\n\n\n<p>Before we go on, I have to tell you that I’m writing a course called <a href=\"https://magicaldevschool.com/courses/unorthodox-tailwind/\">Unorthodox Tailwind</a> — this shows you everything I know about using Tailwind and CSS in synergistic ways, leveraging the strengths of each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shameless plug aside, let’s dive into the Unorthodox Choice now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, the Unorthodox Choice is to write your styles in an unnamed layer — or any layer after utilities, really — so that your CSS naturally overwrites Tailwind utilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of these two, I prefer the unnamed layer option:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* Unnamed layer option */\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities; \n\n/* Write your CSS normally here */ \n.component { /* ... */ }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* Named layer option */\n/* Use whatever layer name you come up with. I simply used css here because it made most sense for explaining things */\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities, css; \n\n@layer css {\n  .component { /* ... */ }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I have many reasons why I do this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I don’t like to add unnecessary CSS layers because it makes code harder to write — more keystrokes, having to remember the specific layer I used it in, etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I’m pretty skilled with <a href=\"https://itcss.io\">ITCSS</a>, selector specificity, and all the good-old-stuff you’d expect from a seasoned front-end developer, so writing CSS in a single layer doesn’t scare me at all.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I can do complex stuff that are hard or impossible to do in Tailwind (like theming and animations) in CSS.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mileage may vary, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you have followed my reasoning so far, you would have noticed that I use Tailwind <em>very</em> differently:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Tailwind utilities are not the “most important” layer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>My unnamed CSS layer is the most important one.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I do this so I can:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Build prototypes with Tailwind</strong> (quickly, easily, especially with the <a href=\"https://splendidlabz/docs/layouts/\">tools</a> I’ve created).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shift these properties to CSS</strong> when they get more complex — so I don’t have to read messy utility-littered HTML that makes my heart sink. Not because utility HTML is bad, but because it takes lots of brain processing power to figure out what’s happening.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, here’s the nice thing about Tailwind being in a utility layer: I can always <code>!important</code> a utility to give it strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code>\n<div class=\"component !p-4\"> ... </div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoa, hold on, wait a minute! Isn’t this wrong, you might ask?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nope. The <code>!important</code> keyword has traditionally been used to override classes. In this case, we’re leveraging on the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/#important-origins-context-and-layers-are-reversed\"><code>!important</code> feature in CSS Layers</a> to say the Tailwind utility is more important than any CSS in the unnamed layer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is perfectly valid and is a built-in feature for CSS Layers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, the <code>!important</code> is so explicit (and used so little) that it makes sense for one-off quick-and-dirty adjustments (without creating a brand new selector for it).</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tailwind-utilities-are-more-powerful-than-they-seem\">Tailwind utilities are more powerful than they seem</h3>\n\n\n<p>Tailwind utilities are not a 1:1 map between a class and a CSS property. Built-in Tailwind utilities mostly look like this so it can give people a wrong impression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailwind utilities are more like <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/tailwinds-apply-feature-is-better-than-it-sounds/\">convenient Sass mixins</a>, which means we can build effective tools for <a href=\"https://splendidlabz.com/docs/layouts/\">layouts</a>, theming, typography, and more, through them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find out about these thoughts inside <a href=\"https://magicaldevschool.com/courses/unorthodox-tailwind/\">Unorthodox Tailwind</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you’re enjoying a new way of looking at (or using) Tailwind!</p>\n<hr>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/using-css-cascade-layers-with-tailwind-utilities/\">Using CSS Cascade Layers With Tailwind Utilities</a> originally published on <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=css-tricks.com&amp;utm_campaign=family_&amp;utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

    "content": "<p>C++ 개발자는 멀티 스레드 환경에서 mutex나 atomic 같은 동기화 도구를 익숙하게 사용합니다. 하지만 이런 도구를 잘 활용해도 동시성 문제가 발생할 수 있으며 이 경우 디버깅에 많은 시간과 노력이 필요합니다.</p>\n\n<p>데이터 레이스(data race)의 개념을 정확히 이해하면 동기화 도구가 어떤 문제를 해결하는지 어떤 상황에서 계속 데이터 레이스가 발생하는지 알 수 있습니다. 이 글에서는 C++의 동시성(concurrency) 문제와 이를 방지하기 위한 스레드 안전성의 주요 개념을 관련 이론 및 사례와 함께 공유합니다. 안정적인 멀티 스레드 코드 작성에 도움이 되기를 바랍니다.</p>\n\n<p>관련 발표 영상은 <a href=\"https://d2.naver.com/helloworld/3078195\">Thread-safety in C++</a>에서 이어보실 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"\">데이터 레이스</h2>\n\n<p>멀티 스레드 환경에서는 서로 다른 스레드가 동시에 같은 데이터에 접근하는데, 이때 접근 방식이 적절하지 않으면 데이터 레이스가 발생할 수 있습니다. 데이터 레이스는 다음 조건을 모두 충족할 때 발생합니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>두 개 이상의 스레드가 하나의 메모리 위치(memory location)에 동시에 접근</li>\n<li>하나 이상이 쓰기 연산을 수행</li>\n<li>하나 이상이 atomic 연산이 아님</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>여기서 '메모리 위치'는 int나 bool 같은 기본 타입(primitive type)의 하나로 이해하면 됩니다.(<a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/memory_model\">표준</a>에서는 더 엄밀하게 정의하고 있습니다.)

보입니다.</p>\n\n<p><strong>숨겨진 의존성</strong></p>\n\n<p>그런데 이 함수가 안전하다고 말하려면, 중요한 전제가 깔려 있어야 합니다. 바로 각 스레드가 생성한 핸들을 외부 동기화 없이 사용할 수 있어야 한다는 점입니다. 그런데 이 전제가 성립하려면, 핸들 타입이 기본적으로 기본 스레드 안전성을 갖추고 있어야 합니다.</p>\n\n<p>만약 핸들들 사이에 공유된 어떤 내부 객체가 있고, 그 접근이 동기화되지 않은 상태라면 즉, 기본 스레드 안전성이 깨져 있다면 이 <code>run_parallel</code> 함수는 더 이상 스레드 안전하지 않습니다.</p>\n\n<p><strong>설계 관점에서의 고민</strong></p>\n\n<p>여기서도 다시 생각해볼 수 있습니다. 핸들 타입이 기본 스레드 안전성을 보장한다고 가정하고, 이 함수가 안전하다고 해도 괜찮을까요? 아니면, 외부 동기화 없이는 안전하지 않다고 보는 게 맞을까요?</p>\n\n<p>이런 질문을 통해 우리는 각 컴포넌트가 기본 스레드 안전성을 보장했을 때 얻을 수 있는 합성성(composability)의 가치를 알 수 있습니다. 하위 레벨 타입이 기본 스레드 안전성을 보장하면 상위 레벨에서 이들을 조합한 코드의 스레드 안전성을 더 쉽게 추론할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"\">기본 스레드 안전성을 왜 보장해야 하나?</h3>\n\n<p>앞에서 본 두 가지 예에서 어느 쪽 의견이 맞을까요?</p>\n\n<p>C++ 커뮤니티의 공통된 의견은 이런 코드가 기본적으로 스레드 안전했으면 좋겠다는 것입니다. 즉, 템플릿에 넣는 타입은 기본 스레드 안전성을 보장할 것이라고 가정하겠다는 것입니다. 이러한 철학에는 몇 가지 중요한 이유가 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>첫째, C++에서는 사용자 정의 타입도 기본 타입처럼 동작하길 기대합니다. 기본 타입은 기본 스레드 안전성을 보장하니까 사용자 정의 타입도 마찬가지로 그렇게 동작하길 기대하는 것입니다. 그래야 기본 타입이든 사용자 정의 타입이든 같은 템플릿 함수에서 문제 없이 다룰 가능성이 높아집니다. 표준 라이브러리의 타입이 기본 스레드 안전성을 보장하는 것도 이러한 바탕에서 설계된 것이라고 이해할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>둘째, 기본 스레드 안전성을 보장하지 않는 타입을 사용하면, 그걸 쓰는 쪽에서 외부 동기화를 직접 처리해야 합니다. 그러면 코드가 복잡해지고 비직관적으로 흐를 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 <code>run_parallel()</code>처럼 스레드마다 독립된 핸들을 사용하는 구조에서 외부 동기화가 필요하다고 하면 대부분 의아해 할 것입니다. 이걸 동기화하려면 global lock을 쓰는 수밖에 없기 때문에 받아들이기 어려워하는 사람도 많을 것입니다.</p>\n\n<p>가능한 한 타입 자체가 기본 스레드 안전성을 보장해 주는 편이, 사용하는 사람 입장에서는 훨씬 단순하고 안전합니다. 그리고 기존에 이미 작성된 코드를 변경하지 않고도 스레드 안전하게 만들 가능성이 높아집니다.</p>\n\n<p>물론, 그렇다고 해서 외부 동기화가 전혀 필요 없다는 이야기는 아닙니다. 외부 동기화는 여전히 필요하며, 이에 대해서는 다음에서 조금 더 자세히 이야기해 보겠습니다.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"externalsynchronization\">외부 동기화(external synchronization)</h2>\n\n<p>지금까지는 타입이 기본 스레드 안전성을 보장하는 경우에 대해서 이야기해 왔습니다. 하지만 이 경우에도 모든 상황이 자동으로 안전해지는 건 아닙니다.</p>\n\n<p>예를 들어, 기본 스레드 안전성만을 보장하는 타입의 동일한 객체에 여러 스레드가 접근한다고 가정해봅시다. 이 중 한 스레드가 non-const 멤버 함수를 호출하고 있고 다른 스레드도 동시에 같은 객체에 접근하고 있다면 문제가 생길 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>이 상황을 안전하게 만들기 위해서는, 그 non-const 함수 호출이 다른 호출과 시간이 겹치지 않음을 보장해야 합니다. 즉, 호출 간에 명확한 연산 간 선후 관계가 성립해야 합니다.</p>\n\n<p>이런 식으로 호출하는 쪽에서 동기화를 책임지고 보장하는 것을 외부 동기화(external synchronization)라고 합니다. 타입 자체가 내부에서 동기화를 하지 않기 때문에, 사용하는 쪽에서 mutex 등을 사용해서 실행 순서가 명확하도록 해야 합니다.</p>\n\n<p>기본 스레드 안전성을 만족하는 타입을 포함해서 모든 타입에 대해 다음과 같은 연산은 데이터 레이스가 없다는 것이 항상 보장됩니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>같은 변수에 대한 연산 간 선후 관계에 있는 쓰기와 읽기</li>\n<li>같은 변수에 대한 연산 간 선후 관계에 있는 쓰기와 쓰기</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>즉, 연산 간 선후 관계만 잘 만들어 준다면 그 자체로 데이터 레이스는 방지할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stdmutex\">std::mutex를 통한 동기화</h3>\n\n<p>외부 동기화를 하기 위해서는, 호출의 연산 간 선후 관계를 명확하게 만들어 줄 수 있는 수단이 필요합니다. 이때 가장 자주 사용되는 도구가 바로 <code>std::mutex</code>입니다.</p>\n\n<p>C++ 메모리 모델에서 <code>std::mutex</code>의 <code>unlock()</code>과 <code>lock()</code>은 특별한 관계입니다. 한 스레드에서 <code>unlock()</code>을 호출하고, 다른 스레드가 같은 mutex에 대해 <code>lock()</code>을 성공적으로 수행하면, 이 두 연산 사이에는 동기화 관계가 성립합니다. 동기화 관계와 순차 실행 관계가 연결되면 연산 간 선후 관계가 만들어집니다. 이에 따르면 한 스레드에서 <code>unlock()</code> 이전에 실행된 모든 연산은, 다른 스레드에서 <code>lock()</code> 이후에 실행되는 연산보다 먼저 실행됨이 보장됩니다. 즉, 이 두 스레드 간에 명확한 연산 간 선후 관계가 만들어지는 것입니다. 이렇게 해서 외부 동기화가 달성됩니다.</p>\n\n<p>mutex가 크리티컬 섹션(critical section) 간 실행이 겹치지 않게 하는 도구 역할을 하는 이면에는 이와 같이 C++ 메모리 모델 관점에서 연산 간 선후 관계를 만드는 매우 중요한 메커니즘이 동작하고 있습니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stdmutex\">std::mutex를 통한 연산 간 선후 관계 형성</h3>\n\n<p>다음 그림은 <code>std::mutex</code>를 사용할 때 C++ 메모리 모델에서 연산 간 선후 관계가 어떻게 형성되는지 보여줍니다.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>앞에서 본 atomic을 사용했을 때의 그림과 일치합니다. 단지 atomic-store-release와 atomic-load-acquire 대신 <code>mutex.unlock()</code>과 <code>mutex.lock()</code>이 사용된 것이 다릅니다.</p>\n\n<p>Thread 1이 <code>mutex.unlock()</code>을 호출하고, Thread 2가 같은 mutex에 대해 <code>lock()</code>을 성공하면, 이 두 연산 사이에 동기화 관계가 생깁니다. 이것 때문에 Thread 1에서 A에 3을 쓴 것과 Thread 2에서 이를 3으로 읽는 것 사이에 연산 간 선후 관계가 완성됩니다.</p>\n\n<p>이것이 C++에서 여러 스레드에서 접근하는 동일 메모리 위치에 대한 연산 간의 순서를 정하는 방식입니다. 이런 순서 관계가 명확히 성립하지 않으면, 값이 제대로 전달되지 않거나 동기화가 되지 않아서 데이터 레이스, 즉 미정의 행동이 발생할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stdatomic\">std::atomic을 통한 외부 동기화</h3>\n\n<p>이번에는 <code>std::mutex</code> 대신 <code>std::atomic</code>을 써서 외부 동기화 효과를 달성하는 방법을 살펴보겠습니다. 앞의 예와 비슷한 패턴인데, 변수명을 좀 더 와 닿게 지어봤습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\"></p>\n\n<p>왼쪽 스레드는 payload를 준비한 후 ready 플래그를 설정하고, 오른쪽 스레드는 ready 플래그가 설정될 때까지 기다렸다가 payload를 읽습니다. payload에 대한 쓰기-읽기 간에 실행 순서를 정해 주는 것이 외부 동기화입니다.</p>\n\n<p>이 두 스레드는 ready라는 플래그를 통해 서로의 작업 순서를 조율하는데, 핵심은 바로 이 <code>ready = true</code> 쓰기가 atomic-store-release이고 <code>while (!ready) {}</code> 읽기가 atomic-load-acquire라는 것입니다. 이 사이에는 atomic 연산의 동기화 관계가 형성되고, 그로 인해 payload에 대한 쓰기와 읽기 사이에도 연산 간 선후 관계가 만들어집니다.</p>\n\n<p>그런데 이 연산 간 선후 관계는 payload에 직접 작용하는 게 아니라, ready라는 제3의 atomic 변수를 통해 간접적으로 만들어진다는 게 포인트입니다. 따라서 payload는 <code>std::atomic</code>일 필요도 없고, 동기화 자체는 ready를 중심으로 이루어집니다.</p>\n\n<p>이처럼 <code>std::atomic</code>은 단순히 동시 접근해도 안전한 기본 타입 정도가 아니라, 외부 동기화의 기준점으로도 아주 효과적으로 사용될 수 있습니다. 그리고 이런 식의 동기화 패턴은 실제 멀티 스레드 코드에서 자주 쓰이는 기본기 중 하나입니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"memory_orderrelaxed\">memory_order::relaxed 사용 시 주의 사항</h3>\n\n<p>만약 <code>ready.store()</code>, <code>ready.load()</code>에 <code>memory_order::relaxed</code>를 넣으면 어떻게 될까요?</p>\n\n<p>이 경우에는 store와 load 사이에 동기화 관계가 성립하지 않게 됩니다. 그 결과, ready를 중심으로 한 연산 간 선후 관계가 만들어지지 않고, 자연히 payload에 대한 쓰기와 읽기 사이에도 연산 간 선후 관계가 사라집니다. 즉, 두 스레드가 payload에 대해 순서 관계가 정의되지 않은 쓰기와 읽기를 수행한 것이 되기 때문에, 이는 데이터 레이스에 해당합니다. 그리고 C++에서 데이터 레이스는 곧 미정의 행동입니다.</p>\n\n<p>많은 사람이 atomic 변수에 대한 load, store 연산에 <code>memory_order::relaxed</code> 옵션을 사용하는데, 그냥 빨라져서 좋은 거다 정도로 생각하고 마구잡이로 쓰면 안 됩니다. 물론 단독 변수로서 다른 데이터와 관련이 없는 경우에는 유용한 옵션입니다. 실제로 사용하기 전에 해당 atomic 변수를 쓰고 읽을 때 이전에 실행했던 내용이 이후에 영향을 미치려는 의도가 있는지 확인해 보는 것이 좋습니다.</p>\n\n<p>이번 예에서, ready에 대한 쓰기와 읽기가 relaxed이더라도 payload가 atomic 변수였다면 데이터 레이스로 이어지지는 않았을 것입니다. 그렇지만 순서 관계가 없기 때문에 왼쪽 스레드에서 payload에 쓴 7이라는 값을 오른쪽 스레드에서 읽게 된다는 보장은 없고, 그 이전의 어떤 값을 읽게 될 수도 있습니다. 이건 의도한 상황이 아닐 테니까, ready에 relaxed 옵션을 쓰기 전에 이런 상황이 발생하지 않을지 확인을 해 보는 게 좋겠습니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"synchronizeswith\">동기화 관계(synchronizes-with)를 제공하는 함수</h3>\n\n<p>지금까지 동기화 관계에 대해 설명했는데, 사실 cppreference.com에서도 많이 언급되는 용어입니다. 몇 가지 예를 발췌해 왔습니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>std::mutex::lock()\n<ul><li>Prior unlock() operations on the same mutex <em>synchronize-with</em> (as defined in std::memory_order) this operation.</li></ul></li>\n<li>std::async()\n<ul><li>the associated thread completion <em>synchronizes-with</em> the successful return from the first function that is waiting on the shared state...</li></ul></li>\n<li>std::thread::join()\n<ul><li>The completion of the thread identified by *this <em>synchronizes with</em> the corresponding successful return from join().</li></ul></li>\n<li>std::call_once()\n<ul><li>The return from the returning call <em>synchronizes-with</em> the returns from all passive calls on the same flag.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>가장 익숙한 예는 <code>std::mutex::lock()</code>입니다. 한 스레드에서 <code>unlock()</code>을 호출하면, 그 이후 다른 스레드가 같은 mutex에 대해 <code>lock()</code>을 수행하는 그 순간, 두 연산 사이에 동기화 관계가 만들어진다고 설명하고 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>두 번째는 <code>std::async()</code>입니다. 문서 설명에 따르면, 백그라운드에서 실행된 스레드의 완료 시점은 그 결과를 기다리는 함수의 반환과 동기화 관계를 형성합니다. 이 말은 즉, <code>future.get()</code>을 호출하면, 이는 async로 실행된 함수의 작업이 모두 끝난 뒤라는 보장이 생기는 것입니다.</p>\n\n<p>세 번째는 <code>std::thread::join()</code>입니다. 어떤 스레드가 완료되면, <code>join()</code>을 호출한 쪽은 그 스레드의 작업이 모두 끝났다는 것을 보장받습니다. 그래서 <code>join()</code> 호출 이후에는 그 스레드가 수행한 메모리 연산 결과를 안전하게 관찰할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>마지막으로, <code>std::call_once()</code>도 있습니다. 여러 스레드가 동시에 진입하려고 해도 단 한 번만 실행됨을 보장해주는 도구인데, 최초로 실행을 완료한 스레드가 메모리에 변경했던 내용이, 이후 모든 passive call이 반환한 후에도 다 보인다는 말입니다.</p>\n\n<p>synchronizes-with는 단순히 atomic 연산에서만 등장하는 개념이 아니라, C++ 표준 라이브러리의 다양한 동기화 도구에서 폭넓게 사용되는 개념입니다.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"internallysynchronizedtype\">내부 동기화 타입(internally synchronized type)</h2>\n\n<p>지금까지는 외부 동기화, 즉 객체 바깥에서 동기화하는 방식을 설명했습니다. 그러면 이제 '아예 타입 자체가 스레드 안전하면 안 되나?'라는 질문이 나올 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>예를 들어 어떤 사용자 정의 타입이 있는데, 그 타입의 non-const 멤버 함수를 여러 스레드에서 동시에 호출하고 싶다고 해봅시다. 그리고 그런 동시 호출이 전혀 문제가 없게 만들고 싶다면 어떻게 해야 할까요?</p>\n\n<p>이럴 때 우리가 만들고자 하는 타입이 바로 내부 동기화 타입입니다. 말 그대로, 내부에서 자체 동기화를 수행하는 타입입니다. 즉, 객체의 사용자가 별도로 mutex나 atomic 변수를 활용하지 않아도 되게끔 설계된 타입입니다. 흔히 말하는 스레드 안전 타입(thread safe type)입니다.</p>\n\n<p>물론 내부 동기화 타입을 제대로 만드는 건 쉽지 않은 일입니다. 경쟁 조건(race)이 없도록 인터페이스를 설계해야 하고, 데드락 위험 등도 고려해야 합니다. 여기에서는 이런 타입을 만드는 기법에 대해서는 다루지 않고, 그보다는 내부 동기화 타입이 만들어지는 이론적인 원리에 중점을 두어 설명하겠습니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"\">기본 스레드 안전성만 보장하는 타입으로 내부 동기화 타입 만들기 시도(실패)</h3>\n\n<p>내부 동기화 타입을 만들어보려는 첫 번째 시도를 살펴보겠습니다. 하지만 이 시도는 실패했습니다.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">class thread_safe_counter {  \n    bool locked = false;\n    int id = 0;\npublic:  \n    int next_id() { // non-const 멤버 함수를 데이터 레이스가 없도록 만들어야 함\n        while (locked) // (1) 읽기\n            ;\n        locked = true; // (2) 쓰기\n        int x = id++;\n        locked = false; // (3) 쓰기\n        return x;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>이 <code>thread_safe_counter</code> 클래스는 고유한 ID를 생성하는 <code>next_id()</code> 함수를 제공합니다. 여러 스레드가 동시에 호출할 수 있기 때문에 내부 동기화가 필요하다고 판단해서, locked라는 플래그를 만들어 사용했습니다. 하지만 이 코드는 제대로 동작하지 않습니다. 왜 그럴까요?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>(1)과 (2)가 원자적으로 실행되지 않음</li>\n<li>(1)-(2), (2)-(2), (2)-(3), (1)-(3), (3)-(3) 연산 간 데이터 레이스 발생</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>첫 번째 문제는 (1)과 (2) 사이에 틈이 있다는 것입니다. 한 스레드가 locked가 false임을 확인한 직후에, 다른 스레드가 끼어들어서 locked를 true로 바꿀 수 있습니다. 그러면 두 스레드가 모두 크리티컬 섹션에 들어가는 문제가 생깁니다.</p>\n\n<p>두 번째는 더 근본적인 문제입니다. locked 변수 자체가 bool 타입인데, 이는 C++에서 기본 스레드 안전성만 보장하는 타입입니다. 즉, 여러 스레드가 동시에 locked를 읽고 쓰는 것 자체가 데이터 레이스를 일으킵니다.</p>\n\n<p>예전에는 'bool 같은 간단한 타입은 여러 스레드가 동시에 접근해도 괜찮을 거야'라고 생각하는 경우가 많았습니다. 하지만 C++에서 메모리 모델과 데이터 레이스가 정의된 이후로는, 이런 접근 방식은 모두 미정의 행동이 되었습니다.</p>\n\n<p>결국 이 문제를 해결하려면 더 강력한 스레드 안전성을 보장하는 타입이 필요합니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"\">내부 동기화 타입 구현의 핵심 원리</h3>\n\n<p>앞의 예에서 보듯, bool과 int 같은 기본 스레드 안전성만을 보장하는 타입만으로는 내부 동기화 타입을 만들 수 없습니다.</p>\n\n<p>왜 그럴까요? non-const 멤버 함수가 동시에 호출될 수 있는 상황에서, 이런 타입은 그 자체로 동시 접근에 대한 충분한 보호를 제공하지 않기 때문입니다. 내부에서 동기화를 책임져야 하는데, 그걸 기본 스레드 안전성까지만 보장하는 타입만으로 구현하려다 보면 결국 데이터 레이스에 빠지게 됩니다.</p>\n\n<p>그래서 중요한 결론이 나옵니다. 내부 동기화 타입을 만들고 싶다면, 그 내부 구성 요소 중에도 이미 내부 동기화 타입이 필요하다는 것입니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"\">내부 동기화 타입 만들기 시도(성공)</h3>\n\n<p>앞에서 본 <code>thread_safe_counter</code> 구현을 다시 시도해 봅시다. 이번에는 <code>thread_safe_queue</code>라는 클래스가 있어서 이걸 사용해 보겠습니다. 이 클래스는 이미 내부 동기화 타입입니다.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">class thread_safe_counter {  \n    thread_safe_queue q {0}; // 내부 동기화 사용\npublic:  \n    int next_id() { // non-const 멤버 함수를 데이터 레이스가 없도록 만들어야 함.\n        std::optional x;\n        while (!x.has_value())\n            x = q.pop_if_not_empty(); // (1)\n        int y = x.value() + 1;\n        q.push(y); // (2)\n        return x.value();\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>이전에는 단순히 bool 변수만 가지고 동기화를 시도했기 때문에 여러 스레드가 동시에 접근할 때 데이터 레이스가 발생했습니다. 하지만 이번에는 <code>thread_safe_queue</code>가 내부 동기화를 제공하기 때문에, 이 큐를 기반으로 한 <code>next_id()</code> 함수는 동시에 여러 스레드가 호출하더라도 안전하게 동작할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>구조를 보면, <code>pop_if_not_empty()</code>를 사용해서 숫자를 꺼내는 방식으로 ID를 생성하고 있는데, 이 과정에서 여러 스레드가 동시에 접근해도 (1)-(1), (1)-(2), (2)-(2) 사이에 데이터 레이스가 발생하지 않도록 보장됩니다.</p>\n\n<p>그런데 여기서 한 가지 궁금증이 생깁니다. 그렇다면 thread_safe_queue는 어떻게 구현되어 있을까요? 이 타입은 스스로 내부 동기화를 제공한다고 했는데, 그 내부에서는 뭔가 다른 더 하위의 동기화 메커니즘, 즉 또 다른 내부 동기화 타입이 필요할 것입니다.</p>\n\n<p>이는 마치 닭과 달걀의 문제 같아 보일 수 있습니다. 하지만 다행히 C++ 표준 라이브러리에서는 이미 내부 동기화 타입을 제공합니다. 대표적으로 <code>std::atomic</code>과 <code>std::mutex</code> 같은 타입이 그런 역할을 합니다. 이런 기본 블록을 활용해서 더 복잡한 내부 동기화 타입을 만들어나갈 수 있는 것입니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"synchronizationprimitive\">동기화 기본 요소(synchronization primitive)</h3>\n\n<p>앞에서 <code>thread_safe_queue</code> 같은 타입을 만들려면, 그 내부에 또 다른 내부 동기화 타입이 필요하다고 했습니다.</p>\n\n<p>그럼 이제 질문이 생깁니다. '맨 아래까지 내려가면, 결국 무엇을 기반으로 동기화를 구현하는가?' 바로 그 역할을 하는 것이 동기화 기본 요소입니다. 여기에는 여러분이 잘 아는 <code>std::atomic</code>, <code>std::mutex</code>, <code>std::condition_variable</code>, 그리고 <code>std::future</code> 같은 것이 포함됩니다.</p>\n\n<p>이런 기본 요소는 그 자체로 내부 동기화 타입이거나, 그런 타입을 내부 구현에 포함하고 있습니다. 예를 들어 mutex의 <code>lock()</code>과 <code>unlock()</code> 모두 non-const 멤버 함수인데, 여러 스레드가 동시에 호출해도 데이터 레이스가 발생하지 않습니다.</p>\n\n<p>이 기본 요소들이 더 고수준의 동기화 타입을 구현하는 데 사용되고, 이 고수준의 동기화 타입을 조합해서 또 더 고수준의 동기화 타입을 만들 수 있는 것입니다.</p>\n\n<p>다음은 앞에서 본 <code>thread_safe_queue</code>를 구현할 때 내부에 <code>std::mutex</code> 같은 동기화 기본 요소를 사용해서 구현하는 예입니다.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">template   \nclass thread_safe_queue {  \n    std::mutex mtx; // std::mutex는 C++가 제공하는 그 자체로 내부 동기화 타입이다.\n    std::queue base;\npublic:  \n    void push(const T&amp; x) {\n        mtx.lock();\n        base.push(x);\n        mtx.unlock();\n    }\n    std::optional pop_if_not_empty() {\n        std::optional ret;\n        mtx.lock();\n        if (!base.empty()) {\n            ret = base.front();\n            base.pop();\n        }\n        mtx.unlock();\n        return ret;\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>여기서 <code>std::mutex</code>는 이 타입 자체가 이미 C++에서 보장하는 내부 동기화 타입이기 때문에, 우리가 따로 이를 동기화할 필요가 없습니다. 그냥 <code>lock()</code>과 <code>unlock()</code>을 적절히 호출하기만 하면 됩니다.</p>\n\n<p>코드를 보면 <code>push()</code> 함수와 <code>pop_if_not_empty()</code> 함수가 있는데, 단순히 함수 앞뒤로 <code>lock()</code>과 <code>unlock()</code>을 넣어서 보호를 하고 있습니다. 그러면 이 멤버 함수 호출 간에 연산 간 선후 관계가 만들어지고, 여러 스레드가 동시에 접근해도 데이터 레이스가 발생하지 않습니다.</p>\n\n<p><code>std::mutex</code>부터는 더 이상 바닥으로 내려갈 고민을 하지 않아도 됩니다. 하지만 사실 mutex도 또 다른 내부 동기화 타입인 <code>std::atomic</code>으로 구현하는 것이 가능합니다. 다음에서 살펴보겠습니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stdatomicmutex\">std::atomic을 사용한 mutex 구현</h3>\n\n<p>다음은 <code>std::atomic</code>을 사용해 mutex를 구현한 예입니다.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-cpp\">class mutex {  \n// mutex를 다른 내부 동기화 타입인 std::atomic으로 구현할 수 있다.\n    std::atomic locked = false;\npublic:  \n    void lock() {\n        while (locked.exchange(true, std::memory_order::acquire))\n            // 참고: busy loop를 피하려면 'locked.wait(true);'를 써도 된다.\n            ;\n    }\n    void unlock() {\n        locked.store(false, std::memory_order::release);\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><code>std::atomic</code>도 동기화 기본 요소로서 내부 동기화 타입이기 때문에 이런 구현이 가능합니다.</p>\n\n<p>이 구현은 일종의 spinlock 형태의 mutex인데, locked라는 <code>std::atomic</code> 변수를 가지고 있습니다. <code>lock()</code> 함수는 이 locked 값을 true로 바꾸고 이전 상태가 false인지 확인합니다. 이미 다른 스레드가 true로 설정해 놓은 상태라면, 계속 루프를 돌면서 기다립니다. 물론 여기서 atomic <code>wait()</code> 함수를 사용하면 busy loop를 피할 수도 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p><code>unlock()</code>에서는 단순히 locked를 false로 바꿉니다. 그러면 <code>lock()</code>을 실행하는 다른 스레드 중 하나가 이것을 읽고 루프에서 빠져나올 수 있습니다. 이런 식으로 mutex로서 동작할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>그리고 <code>exchange()</code>에서 사용한 <code>memory_order::acquire</code>과 <code>store()</code>에서 사용한 <code>memory_order::release</code>는 mutex가 동기화 관계를 제공하기 위해 필요한 것입니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"\">동기화 기본 요소의 상호 구현 가능성</h3>\n\n<p>앞에서 mutex를 atomic으로 구현해 보았습니다. 반대로 atomic을 mutex로 구현하는 것도 당연히 가능합니다. 어렵지 않을 것입니다.</p>\n\n<p>사실 이런 동기화 기본 요소들은 서로를 이용해서 구현할 수 있습니다. 그래서 어떤 것이 더 근본적(primitive)인가 하는 질문은 큰 의미가 없습니다.</p>\n\n<p>많은 언어에는 동시성 문제를 해결하기 위한 각자의 패러다임이 있습니다. 어떤 언어는 기본 요소로 mutex가 아니라 스레드 간 메시지 채널을 사용하기도 합니다. 이 또한 서로를 이용해 구현할 수 있습니다. 결국 다 같은 문제를 해결하려는 서로 다른 방법일 뿐이지 논리적으로 동등하다는 것을 이해하면 좋겠습니다.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"\">마치며</h2>\n\n<p>지금까지 C++에서 스레드 안전성을 보장하는 방법에 대해 살펴봤습니다. 주요 내용을 정리하면 다음과 같습니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>데이터 레이스 개념에서 출발하여 기본 타입에 대한 기본 스레드 안전성 조건을 살펴보며 데이터 레이스가 발생하지 않게 하는 조건을 이해했습니다.</li>\n<li>기본 스레드 안전성 조건을 사용자 정의 타입에도 확장할 수 있으며, C++ 표준 라이브러리 타입은 모두 이 조건을 만족하고 있습니다. 사용자 정의 타입도 이 조건을 만족해야 표준 라이브러리와 잘 섞어 쓸 수 있습니다.</li>\n<li>외부 동기화에서는 단순히 잠금이나 atomic을 사용하는 것보다 더 본질적으로, 동기화 관계를 만들어야 한다는 점이 중요합니다. 이를 통해 연산 간 선후 관계를 보장하고 데이터 레이스를 방지할 수 있습니다.</li>\n<li>내부 동기화 타입은 기본 스레드 안전성 수준을 넘어서, non-const 멤버 함수도 동시 호출이 가능한 타입입니다.</li>\n<li>내부 동기화 타입을 만들기 위해서는 결국 다른 내부 동기화 타입이 필요하며, 맨 바닥까지 내려가면 atomic, mutex, condition_variable 같은 동기화 기본 요소를 사용해야 합니다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>이렇게 계층적으로 구성된 스레드 안전성 개념을 이해하면 멀티 스레드 환경에서 안전하고 효율적인 C++ 코드를 작성할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>이 글이 C++에서 스레드 안전성을 체계적으로 이해하는 데 도움이 되었기를 바랍니다. 감사합니다.</p>",

    "content": "\n<p><em>Blob, Blob, Blob</em>. You hate them. You love them. Personally, as a design illiterate, I like to overuse them… a lot. And when you repeat the same process over and over again, it’s only a question of how much you can optimize it, or in this case, what’s the easiest way to create blobs in CSS? Turns out, as always, there are many approaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387089\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>To know if our following blobs are worth using, we’ll need them to pass three tests:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They can be with just a single element (and preferably without pseudos).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>They can be easily designed (ideally through an online tool).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We can use gradient backgrounds, borders, shadows, and other CSS effects on them.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Without further ado, let’s&nbsp;<em>Blob, Blob, Blob</em>&nbsp;right in.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"just-generate-them-online\">Just generate them online</h3>\n\n\n<p>I know it’s disenchanting to click on an article about making blobs in CSS just for me to say you can generate them outside CSS. Still, it’s probably the most common way to create blobs on the web, so to be thorough, these are some online tools I’ve used before to create <strong>SVG</strong> blobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://app.haikei.app/\">Haikei</a>.</strong> Probably the one I have used the most since, besides blobs, it can also generate lots of SVG backgrounds.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.blobmaker.app/\">Blobmaker</a>.</strong> A dedicated tool for making blobs. It’s apparently part of Haikei now, so you can use both.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lastly, almost all graphic programs let you hand-draw blobs and export them as SVGs.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, this is one I generated just now. Keep it around, as it will come in handy later.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=829%2C766&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Randomly shaped blob in bright red.\" class=\"wp-image-387090\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?w=829&amp;ssl=1 829w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=300%2C277&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=768%2C710&amp;ssl=1 768w\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <path></path>\n</svg></code></pre>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"using-border-radius-\">Using <code>border-radius</code></h3>\n\n\n<p>While counterintuitive, we can use the&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/border-radius/\">border-radius</a></code>&nbsp;property to create blobs. This technique isn’t new by any means; it was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://9elements.com/blog/css-border-radius-can-do-that/\">first described by Nils Binder</a>&nbsp;in 2018, but it is still fairly unknown. Even for those who use it, the inner workings are not entirely clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start, you may know the&nbsp;<code>border-radius</code>&nbsp;is a shorthand to each individual corner’s radius, going from the top left corner clockwise. For example, we can set each corner’s&nbsp;<code>border-radius</code>&nbsp;to get a bubbly square shape:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><div class=\"blob\"></div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.blob {\n  border-radius: 25% 50% 75% 100%;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, what&nbsp;<code>border-radius</code>&nbsp;does — and also why it’s called “radius” — is to shape each corner following a circle of the given radius. For example, if we set the top left corner to&nbsp;<code>25%</code>, it will follow a circle with a radius&nbsp;<code>25%</code>&nbsp;the size of the shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.blob {\n  border-top-left-radius: 25%;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s less known is that each corner property is still a&nbsp;<em>shortcut</em>&nbsp;towards its horizontal and vertical radii. Normally, you set both radii to the same value, getting a circle, but you can set them individually to create an ellipse. For example, the following sets the horizontal radius to&nbsp;<code>25%</code>&nbsp;of the element’s width and the vertical to&nbsp;<code>50%</code>&nbsp;of its height:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.blob {\n  border-top-left-radius: 25% 50%;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We can now shape each corner like an ellipse, and it is the combination of all four ellipses that creates the illusion of a blob! Just take into consideration that to use the horizontal and vertical radii syntax through the&nbsp;<code>border-radius</code>&nbsp;property, we’ll need to separate the horizontal from the vertical radii using a forward slash (<code>/</code>).</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.blob {\n  border-radius:\n    /* horizontal */\n    100% 30% 60% 70% /\n    /* vertical */\n    50% 40% 70% 70%;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The syntax isn’t too intuitive, so designing a blob from scratch will likely be a headache. Luckily,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/\">Nils Binder made a tool</a>&nbsp;exactly for that!</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"blobbing-blobs-together\">Blobbing blobs together</h4>\n\n\n<p>This hack is awesome. We aren’t supposed to use&nbsp;<code>border-radius</code>&nbsp;like that, but we still do. Admittedly, we are limited to boring blobs. Due to the nature of&nbsp;<code>border-radius</code>, no matter how hard we try, we will only get convex shapes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?resize=1024%2C576\" alt=\"Concave and convex shapes\" class=\"wp-image-387123\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/convex_concave_i8a0vu.webp?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just going off&nbsp;<code>border-radius</code>, we can try to minimize it a little by sticking more than one blob together:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I don’t want to spend too much time on this technique since it is too impractical to be worth it. To name a few drawbacks:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We are using more than one element or, at the very least, an extra pseudo-element. Ideally, we want to keep it to one element.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We don’t have a tool to prototype our blobby amalgamations, so making one is a process of trial and error.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We can’t use borders, gradients, or box shadows since they would reveal the element’s outlines.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"multiple-backgrounds-and-svg-filters\">Multiple backgrounds and SVG filters</h3>\n\n\n<p>This one is an improvement in the Gooey Effect,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/gooey-effect/\">described here by Lucas Bebber</a>, although I don’t know who first came up with it. In the original effect, several elements can be morphed together like drops of liquid sticking to and flowing out of each other:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It works by first blurring shapes nearby, creating some connected shadows. Then we crank up the contrast, forcing the blur out and smoothly connecting them in the process. Take, for example, this demo by Chris Coyer (It’s from 2014, so more than 10 years ago!):</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at the code, you’ll notice Chris uses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/\"><code>filter</code></a>&nbsp;property along the&nbsp;<code>blur()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>contrast()</code>&nbsp;functions, which I’ve also seen in other blob demos. To be specific, it applies&nbsp;<code>blur()</code>&nbsp;on each individual circle and then&nbsp;<code>contrast()</code>&nbsp;on the parent element. So, if we have the following HTML:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><div class=\"blob\">\n  <div class=\"subblob\"></div>\n  <div class=\"subblob\"></div>\n  <div class=\"subblob\"></div>\n</div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>…we would need to apply filters and background colors as such:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.blob {\n  filter: contrast(50);\n  background: white; /* Solid colors are necessary */\n}\n\n.subblob {\n  filter: blur(15px);\n  background: black; /* Solid colors are necessary */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is a good reason why those demos stick to white shapes and black backgrounds (or vice versa) since things get unpredictable once colors aren’t contrast-y enough. See it for yourself in the following demo by changing the color. Just be wary:&nbsp;<em>shades get ugly</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To solve this, we will use an SVG filter instead. I don’t want to get too technical on SVG (if you want to, read Luca’s post!). In a nutshell, we can apply blurring and contrast filters using SVGs, but now, we can also pick which color channel we apply the contrast to, unlike normal&nbsp;<code>contrast()</code>, which modifies all colors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we want to leave color channels (<code>R</code>,&nbsp;<code>G</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>B</code>) untouched, we will only crank the contrast up for the alpha channel. That translates to the next SVG filter, which can be embedded in the HTML:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <defs>\n    <filter id=\"blob\">\n      <feGaussianBlur></feGaussianBlur>\n      <feColorMatrix></feColorMatrix>\n      <feBlend></feBlend>\n    </filter>\n  </defs>\n</svg></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To apply it, we will use again&nbsp;<code>filter</code>, but this time we’ll set it to&nbsp;<code>url(\"#blob\")</code>, so that it pulls the SVG from the HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.blob {\n  filter: url(\"#blob\");\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we can even use it with gradient backgrounds!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, this approach comes with two small, but important, changes to common CSS filters:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The filter is applied to the parent element, not the individual shapes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The parent element must be transparent (which is a huge advantage). To change the background color, we can instead change the body or other ancestors’ background, and it will work with no issues.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s left is to place the&nbsp;<code>.subblob</code>&nbsp;elements together such that they make a blobby enough shape, then apply the SVG filters to morph them:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"making-it-one-element\">Making it one element</h4>\n\n\n<p>This works well, but it has a similar issue to the blob we made by morphing several&nbsp;<code>border-radius</code> instances: too many elements for a simple blob. Luckily, we can take advantage of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/\"><code>background</code></a>&nbsp;property to create multiple shapes and morph them together using SVG filters, all in a single element. Since we are keeping it to one element, we will go back to just one&nbsp;empty <code>.blob</code> div:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-markup\" data-line=\"\"><code><div class=\"blob\"></div></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To recap, the&nbsp;<code>background</code>&nbsp;shorthand can set all background properties and also set multiple backgrounds at once. Of all the properties, we only care about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-image/\"><code>background-image</code></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-position/\"><code>background-position</code></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-size/\"><code>background-size</code></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we will use&nbsp;<code>background-image</code>&nbsp;along with&nbsp;<code>radial-gradient()</code>&nbsp;to create a circle inside the element:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>body {\n  background: radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000);\n  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Important! */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is what each parameter does:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><code>farthest-side</code>:</strong> Confines the shape to the element’s box farthest from its center. This way, it is kept as a circle.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code>var(--blob-color) 100%</code>:</strong> Fills the background shape from 0 to 100% with the same color, so it ends up as a solid color.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><code>#0000</code>:</strong> After the shape is done, it makes a full stop to transparency, so the color ends.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The next part is moving and resizing the circle using the&nbsp;<code>background-position</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>background-size</code>&nbsp;properties. Luckily, both can be set on&nbsp;<code>background</code>&nbsp;after the gradient, separated from each other by a forward slash (<code>/</code>).</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>body {\n  background: radial-gradient(...) 20% 30% / 30% 40%;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat; /* Important! */\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The first pair of percentages sets the shape’s horizontal and vertical position (taking as a reference the top-left corner), while the second pair sets the shape’s width and height (taking as a reference the element’s size).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned, we can stack up different backgrounds together, which means we can create as many circles/ellipses as we want! For example, we can create three ellipses on the same element:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.blob {\n  background:\n    radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000) 20% 30% / 30% 40%, \n    radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000) 80% 50% / 40% 60%, \n    radial-gradient(farthest-side, var(--blob-color) 100%, #0000) 50% 70% / 50% 50%;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s even better is that SVG filters don’t care whether shapes are made of elements or backgrounds, so we can also morph them together using the last&nbsp;<code>url(#blob)</code>&nbsp;filter!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>While this method may be a little too much for blobs, it unlocks squishing, stretching, dividing, and merging blobs <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/gooey-effect/#aa-making-things-stick\">in seamless animations</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, all these tricks are awesome, but not enough for what we want! We accomplished reducing the blob to a single element, but we still can’t use gradients, borders, or shadows on them, and also, they are tedious to design and model. Then, that brings us to the ultimate blob approach…</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"using-the-new-shape-function\">Using the <code>shape()</code> function</h3>\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, there is a new way to make blobs that just dropped to CSS: the&nbsp;<code>shape()</code>&nbsp;function!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll explain&nbsp;<code>shape()</code>‘s syntax briefly, but for an in-depth explanation, you’ll want to check out both <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/s/shape/\">this explainer from the CSS-Tricks Almanac </a>as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/author/afiftemani/\">Temani Afif</a>‘s three-part&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/better-css-shapes-using-shape-part-1-lines-and-arcs/\">series on the&nbsp;<code>shape()</code>&nbsp;function</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://frontendmasters.com/blog/creating-blob-shapes-using-clip-path-shape/\">his recent article about&nbsp;blobs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, the CSS&nbsp;<code>shape()</code>&nbsp;function is used alongside the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/clip-path/\"><code>clip-path</code></a>&nbsp;property to cut elements into any shape we want. More specifically, it uses a verbal version of SVG’s&nbsp;<code>path</code>&nbsp;syntax. The syntax has lots of commands for lots of types of lines, but when blobbing with&nbsp;<code>shape()</code>, we’ll define curves using the&nbsp;<code>curve</code>&nbsp;command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.blob {\n  clip-path: shape(\n    from X0 Y0, \n    curve to X1 Y1 with Xc1 Yc1, \n    curve to X2 Y2 with Xc21 Yc21 / Xc22 Yc22\n    /* ... */\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s break down each parameter:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>X0 Y0</code>&nbsp;defines the starting point of the shape.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>curve</code>&nbsp;starts the curve where&nbsp;<code>X1 Y1</code>&nbsp;is the next point of the shape, while&nbsp;<code>Xc1 Yc1</code>&nbsp;defines a control point used in Bézier curves.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The next parameter is similar, but we used&nbsp;<code>Xc21 Yc21 / Xc22 Yc22</code>&nbsp;instead to define two control points on the Bézier curve.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I honestly don’t understand Bézier curves and control points completely, but luckily, we don’t need them to use&nbsp;<code>shape()</code>&nbsp;and blobs! Again,&nbsp;<code>shape()</code>&nbsp;uses a verbal version of SVG’s&nbsp;<code>path</code>&nbsp;syntax, so it can draw any shape an SVG can, which means that we can translate the SVG blobs we generated earlier… and CSS-ify them. To do so, we’ll grab the&nbsp;<code>d</code>&nbsp;attribute (which defines the&nbsp;<code>path</code>) from our SVG and paste it into Temani’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-generators.com/svg-to-css/\">SVG to&nbsp;<code>shape()</code>&nbsp;generator</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the exact code the tool generated for me:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.blob {\n  aspect-ratio: 0.925; /* Generated too! */\n\n  clip-path: shape(\n    from 91.52% 26.2%,\n    curve to 93.52% 78.28% with 101.76% 42.67%/103.09% 63.87%,\n    curve to 44.11% 99.97% with 83.95% 92.76%/63.47% 100.58%,\n    curve to 1.45% 78.42% with 24.74% 99.42%/6.42% 90.43%,\n    curve to 14.06% 35.46% with -3.45% 66.41%/4.93% 51.38%,\n    curve to 47.59% 0.33% with 23.18% 19.54%/33.13% 2.8%,\n    curve to 91.52% 26.2% with 62.14% -2.14%/81.28% 9.66%\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As you might have guessed, it returns our beautiful blob:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s check if it passes our requirements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Yes, they can be made of a single element.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Yes, they can also be created in a generator and then translated into CSS.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Yes, we can use gradient backgrounds, but due to the nature of&nbsp;<code>clip-path()</code>,&nbsp;borders and shadows get cut out.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Two out of three? Maybe two and a half of three? That’s a big improvement over the other approaches, even if it’s not perfect.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n<p>So, alas, we failed to find what I believe is the perfect CSS approach to blobs. I am, however, amazed how something so trivial designing blobs can teach us about so many tricks and new CSS features, many of which I didn’t know myself.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-blob-recipes/\">CSS Blob Recipes</a> originally published on <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=css-tricks.com&amp;utm_campaign=family_&amp;utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">2025년 2월, 토스가 10주년을 맞았어요. 브랜드에게 10년은 결코 짧은 시간이 아니지만, 토스에게는 여전히 갈 길이 먼 ‘초기’일지도 몰라요. 그래서 토스는 이번 10주년을 </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">새로운 출발선으로 삼기로 했어요.</span></span></span></p><figure id=\"21fa360d-33e3-80a6-a4b9-eb8813fd5432\" class=\"css-of5acw\"><img

단순한 타이틀이 아니라, </span><span class=\"css-q3ktjb\">변화의 여정을 시각화</span><span class=\"css-1kxrhf3\">하는 데 집중했어요.</span></span></span></p><figure id=\"21fa360d-33e3-80b8-8db1-e3edf9dffe63\"

여정을 공간에서도 자연스럽게 구현할 수 있다는 점에서 캠페인의 메시지와도 잘 어울린다고 느꼈죠.</span></span></span></p><figure id=\"21fa360d-33e3-8071-8af2-fd18b80759b2\" class=\"css-of5acw\"><img

    "content": "<p>Python은 높은 개발 생산성으로 많이 사랑받는 프로그래밍 언어 중 하나입니다. 하지만 높은 생산성의 대가로 성능에 대해 많은 비용을 지불해야 한다는 것이 정설로 여겨지고 있었습니다.</p>\n\n<p>그러나 <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.11.html#summary-release-highlights\">Python 3.11</a>을 시작으로, 이제는 Python에서도 성능을 챙기려는 노력이 이어지고 있습니다. 그 연장선으로 이 글에서는 프로파일링 도구 중 하나인&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/sumerc/yappi\">Yappi</a>를 활용해서 Python 서버의 성능 개선을 이루어낸 사례를 소개하고자 합니다. 이 글이 Python 애플리케이션의 성능을 더 쉽게 분석하고 최적화하는 데에 도움이 되었으면 좋겠습니다.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"\">배경 지식</h2>\n\n<p>저희가 당면한 문제에 대해 이야기하기 위해, 먼저 주요 용어와 구조를 간단히 설명하겠습니다.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://d2.naver.com/helloworld/6754228\">서치피드</a> 등 최근 네이버에서 새롭게 출시되는 많은 피드의 뒤에는 수많은 컴포넌트가 존재합니다. 피드를 구성하기 위해서는 일련의 과정이 필요합니다. 가장 간단하게 피드를 구성한다고 가정하면 필요한 과정은 다음과 같습니다.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>주어진 질의와 연관된 문서를 DB에서 100개 가져온다.  </li>\n<li>가져온 문서의 피처(feature)를 종합해 순위(랭킹)를 매긴다.  </li>\n<li>가장 높은 랭킹을 얻은 문서 10개를 차례로 노출한다.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>피처란?</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)\">\"In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a data set.\"</a></p>\n  \n  <p>어떤 개체에 대한 정보, 특징을 이야기하며 보통 ML 모델의 입력값으로 사용됩니다. 블로그 문서를 예로 들면, 20대 남성이 해당 문서를 좋아하는 정도를 [0, 1] 사이의 값으로 나타낸 것도 피처라고 할 수 있고, 문서에 포함된 사진의 개수도 피처가 될 수 있습니다. 메타 정보와의 경계성은 모호하나, 저희 팀에서는 한 단계 이상의 정제 과정을 거친 값을 피처로 취급하자'라는 기준을 공유하고 있습니다.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>고품질의 피처는 곧 고품질의 서비스로 이어집니다. 네이버에서는 더 좋은 사용자 경험을 위해 다양한 피처를 활용해 랭킹을 하고 있으며, 다양한 서비스에서 활용할 수 있게 피처 정보를 제공하는 별도의 서버(Feature Serving Agent, 이하 FSA)를 마련했습니다. 그런데 이 구조는 효과적이지만 성능이 만족스럽지 않다는 문제가 있었습니다.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"\">대량의 단순 조회가 너무 느리다는 문제</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"fsa\">FSA란</h3>\n\n<p>FSA는 Redis와 같은 일종의 키-값 저장소입니다. 블로그/카페 문서의 피처를 계산해 DB에 적재하고, 문서의 ID로 피처를 조회할 수 있게 합니다. 이때 고품질 피처를 계산하기 위해 ML 모델을 사용해 배치로 계산합니다.</p>\n\n<p>FSA의 기본 동작은 최대 800개의 문서 ID를 받아 각 문서의 피처 정보를 제공하는 것입니다. Redis와 같은 기존 솔루션을 이용하면 빠르게 개발할 수 있지만 FSA를 사용하게 된 2가지 이유가 있습니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>무한대의 scale-out 필요성: 최대 800개의 문서에 대해서 <code>mget</code> 수행 시 CPU 사용, 응답 시간의 측면에서 성능이 더 뛰어나며, 무엇보다 '이론상' 무한대로 scale-out이 가능한 인하우스 분산 DB를 사용하고자 했습니다. Redis 클러스터는 안정성을 이유로 scale-out 상한이 존재합니다.</li>\n<li>운영 유연성 확보: 다양한 곳에서 쉽게 사용하고 신뢰성 있는 서비스를 제공하기 위해서는 호출처 트래킹, 트래픽 컨트롤, 비즈니스 로직 추가 등의 추가 기능이 필요합니다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"\">성능 테스트 결과</h3>\n\n<p>FSA 개발이 완료되고 <a href=\"https://github.com/naver/ngrinder\">nGrinder</a>를 이용해 성능을 테스트했습니다. 정확한 성능을 측정하고자 캐시는 사용하지 않았습니다.</p>\n\n<p>자세한 성능 테스트 환경은 다음과 같습니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>서버 인스턴스 1대 - 16 CPU 코어(AMD genoa/milan)</li>\n<li>테스트 대상 문서 ID의 개수는 10K, 한 번의 호출당 랜덤으로 800개를 뽑아서 사용</li>\n<li>호출 QPS(query per second)는 85 → 175</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>테스트 결과는 다음과 같습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"d2-1\"></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"d2-2\"></p>\n\n<p>성능 테스트에서 살펴보는 지표는 다양하지만, 가장 기본이며 핵심적인 CPU 사용률과 응답 시간을 살펴보겠습니다. CPU 사용률로 적절한 인스턴스 수를 산정할 수 있고, 응답 시간은 곧 서비스 품질로 이어지기 때문입니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>CPU 사용률은 17.8%(85qps), 36%(175qps)</li>\n<li>평균 응답 시간은 약 44ms, p99 응답 시간은 약 87ms</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>FSA는 2500qps의 요청을 받을 예정이었기 때문에 이를 바탕으로 필요한 서버 인스턴스 수를 산정해 보겠습니다. 저희 팀은 안정적인 서비스를 위해서 인스턴스당 CPU 사용률을 30% 이하로 맞추고 있습니다. CPU 사용률 1%당 약 4.8qps를 받을 수 있으며, 30%의 사용률은 약 144qps입니다. 인스턴스 1대당 144qps를 받을 수 있으므로 필요한 서버는 최소 17대 이상입니다. CPU 코어로 계산하면 272코어가 됩니다.</p>\n\n<p>272코어의 리소스는 절대 작은 수치가 아니며, 팀 내 다른 서버의 리소스 사용률과 비교해서 판단해보면 FSA의 로직은 너무 무거웠습니다. 또한, 하위 1% 응답 시간이 87ms임을 보아 분명히 어딘가에 병목이 존재한다고 생각했습니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"\">병목 지점 찾기</h3>\n\n<p>병목 지점을 찾기에 앞서, 왜 병목 지점을 찾는 것이 중요한지 간단하게 짚고 넘어가겠습니다.</p>\n\n<p>암달의 법칙(Amdahl's law)에 따르면 병렬화 등에 따른 성능 향상은 결국 순차 실행되는 코드의 비율에 제한됩니다. 병렬화를 떠나 실행 시간 관점에서 다시 쉽게 풀어본다면, 이론적으로 얻을 수 있는 최대 속도 향상은 전체 실행 시간 중에서 차지하는 비율로 제한됩니다. 쉽게 말해, 전체 실행 시간의 10%를 차지하는 부분을 최적화해서 2배 빨라졌다고 하더라도 전체를 보면 단 5% 빨라지는 셈입니다.</p>\n\n<p>결국, 들이는 노력에 비해 크게 성능을 향상시키려면 실행 시간의 대부분을 차지하는 지점을 찾아야 합니다. 이러한 병목 지점을 찾아내는 것이 '프로파일링'입니다. 개발자들은 프로파일링에 다양한 방법을 사용합니다. 여기서는 Python을 기준으로 몇 가지 방법을 소개합니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>각 함수의 시작과 끝에서 타임스탬프를 기록해서 확인하기</p>\n\n<p>가장 원시적이고 적용하기 쉬운 방법입니다. 소규모 프로젝트에서는 꽤 빠르고 효과적일 수 있지만, 불필요하게 코드가 길어지며 프로덕션 환경에서는 수행되지 않아야 하기에 번거로울 수 있습니다. 그뿐 아니라 타임스탬프를 기록하는 부분을 놓칠 수도 있다는 단점이 존재합니다.</p></li>\n<li><p>Python에서 기본으로 제공하는 cProfile 라이브러리 사용하기</p>\n\n<p>Python에서 기본으로 제공하므로 신뢰성이 높으며, C로 구현되어 있어 프로파일러로 인한 오버헤드가 매우 낮다는 장점이 있습니다. 하지만 같이 제공되는 패키지이다 보니 기능이 부족하며, 특히 멀티 스레드 환경에서 취약한 모습을 보입니다.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://github.com/pyutils/line_profiler\">line_profiler</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/benfred/py-spy\">py-spy</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sumerc/yappi\">Yappi</a> 등의 서드파티 라이브러리 사용하기</p>\n\n<p>각자 사용성에 맞는 프로파일러 라이브러리를 선택할 수 도 있습니다. 어떤 라이브러리를 사용할지 고민하기까지 비용이 든다는 점이 단점으로 작용하나, 큰 효과를 낼 수 있습니다.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>각 방법의 장단점을 분석한 결과 Yappi를 선택했습니다. 다른 방법을 선택하지 않은 이유는 다음과 같습니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>cProfile은 메인 스레드만 프로파일링합니다. 따라서 멀티 스레드 환경에서 사용하려면 직접 모든 스레드를 프로파일링하고 결과를 합쳐야 합니다.</li>\n<li>line_profiler는 애너테이션 기반으로, 프로파일링하려는 곳마다 <code>@profile</code> 코드를 삽입해야 하는 불편함이 존재합니다.</li>\n<li>py-spy는 샘플링 기반의 프로파일러로, <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/ko/3.13/library/profile.html#what-is-deterministic-profiling\">결정론적 프로파일링</a>이 지원되지 않습니다. 저희는 서비스 환경에서 사용하진 않기 때문에 후보에서 제외했습니다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>정리하면 다음과 같습니다.</p>\n\n<table>  \n<thead>  \n<tr>  \n<th>방법/도구</th>  \n<th>장점</th>  \n<th>단점</th>  \n<th>결정론적 프로파일링</th>  \n<th>멀티 스레드 지원</th>  \n<th>사용 편의성</th>  \n</tr>  \n</thead>  \n<tbody>  \n<tr>  \n<td>수동 타임스탬프 삽입</td>  \n<td>구현이 간단함, 빠른 실험에 적합</td>  \n<td>코드가 지저분해짐, 번거로움, 실수할 가능성 있음</td>  \n<td>예(수동)</td>  \n<td>가능(수동)</td>  \n<td>낮음</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td>cProfile</td>  \n<td>표준 라이브러리, 오버헤드 적음, 신뢰성 높음</td>  \n<td>멀티 스레드 지원 미흡, 기능 제한 있음</td>  \n<td>예</td>  \n<td>제한적</td>  \n<td>중간</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td>line_profiler</td>  \n<td>라인 단위 상세 정보 제공</td>  \n<td>@profile 삽입 필요, 코드 수정 필요</td>  \n<td>예</td>  \n<td>미지원</td>  \n<td>낮음</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td>py-spy</td>  \n<td>비침습적, 라이브 환경에서 사용 가능, 설치 쉬움</td>  \n<td>샘플링 기반, 결정론적 프로파일링 미지원</td>  \n<td>아니오</td>  \n<td>예</td>  \n<td>높음</td>  \n</tr>  \n<tr>  \n<td>Yappi</td>  \n<td>멀티 스레드 완전 지원, 결정론적, 설치 쉬움</td>  \n<td>외부 패키지 설치 필요</td>  \n<td>예</td>  \n<td>예</td>  \n<td>높음</td>  \n</tr>  \n</tbody>  \n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"yappifastapi\">Yappi를 접목한 FastAPI 프로파일링</h2>\n\n<p>그럼 이제 실제로 Yappi를 설정하고 프로파일링해보겠습니다. 기본적인 설치 방법 및 사용 방법은 <a href=\"https://github.com/sumerc/yappi\">Yappi GitHub</a>를 참고합니다. 여기서는 FastAPI에 적용하는 방법을 설명하겠습니다.</p>\n\n<p>FastAPI의 미들웨어 기능을 이용하면 쉽고 깔끔하게 적용할 수 있습니다. 아래는 실제로 사용되는 코드입니다.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># middleware/yappi_profile.py\nimport os  \nfrom contextvars import ContextVar\n\nimport yappi  \nfrom starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware  \nfrom starlette.responses import Response\n\nctx_id: ContextVar[int] = ContextVar(\"yappi_context\")\n\n\ndef get_context_id() -&gt;

DB 칼럼명을 응답의 필드명으로 바꾸는 과정에서 간편하게 바꾸고자 <code>asdict</code>를 사용한 것이 원인이었습니다.</p>\n\n<p>실제 필요한 필드를 정의하고 하드 코딩해, 비싼 연산인 deepcopy의 수행을 막고 다시 프로파일링했습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"d2-7\"></p>\n\n<p>로컬에서 테스트해본 결과 응답 시간은 약 50%가 단축되었습니다. 특히나 FSA는 많은 개수의 아이템을 반환했기에 이 최적화는 큰 효과를 볼 수 있었습니다. 그뿐 아니라 정말 필요한 필드만 남기고 모두 제외하여 네트워크 사용량을 줄이는 효과도 조금이나마 얻을 수 있었습니다.</p>\n\n<p>이제 정말로 끝난 줄 알았지만... 아직 주의해야 할 부분이 하나 더 남았습니다. <code>asyncio.gather()</code>로 호출되는 부분은 아예 caller-callee 사이에 호출 그래프가 끊긴다는 점을 주의해야 합니다.</p>\n\n<p>실제 프로젝트 코드에서는 다음과 같은 부분이 있습니다.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">async def retrieve_items(self):  \n    # 편의상 생략\n    retrievers = [\n        BlogRetriever(ids).retrieve(),\n        CafeRetriever(ids).retrieve(),\n    ]\n    results = await asyncio.gather(*retrievers)\n    return list(chain.from_iterable(results))\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>이 코드의 프로파일링 결과를 보면 다음과 같습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"d2-8\"></p>\n\n<p>유심히 살펴보면 <code>retrieve()</code> 부분이 존재하지 않습니다. 아쉽게도 <code>asyncio.gather()</code>를 사용하면 호출 스택 lineage가 끊기므로, 이 부분은 따로 확인하거나 프로파일링할 때만이라도 <code>await</code>으로 바꿔야 합니다.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">async def retrieve_items(self):  \n    # 편의상 생략\n    return await BlogRetriever(ids, verbose=self.service_context.is_debug).retrieve() + \\\n        await CafeRetriever(ids, verbose=self.service_context.is_debug).retrieve()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>이렇게 바꾸면 다음과 같이 프로파일링 결과가 풍부해진 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"d2-9\"></p>\n\n<p>이를 바탕으로 최적화한 부분은 DB 조회 결과를 Python 딕셔너리 자료 구조로 변경하는 부분입니다. 기존 코드는 다음과 같았습니다.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from google.protobuf.json_format import MessageToJson\n\nparsed_row = json.loads(MessageToJson(response))  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>저희가 사용하는 인하우스 분산 DB는 gRPC 프로토콜로 데이터를 주고 받는데, 이때 DB를 호출하는 레이어에서 protobuf → JSON → Python 딕셔너리의 단계를 거쳤는데 JSON은 사용되지 않았습니다. 따라서 JSON 변환을 건너뛰고 다음과 같이 바로 Python 딕셔너리로 변환을 시도했습니다.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">from google.protobuf import json_format\n\nparsed_row = json_format.MessageToDict(response)  \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>그 결과, 다음과 같이 확연하게 개선되었습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"d2-10\"></p>\n\n<p>간단하게 로컬에서 테스트한 결과, 응답 시간이 절반으로 줄어들었습니다.(환경에 따라 응답 시간은 달라질 수 있기에 절대적인 수치는 참고만 하시기 바랍니다.)</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"로컬\"></p>\n\n<p>위의 개선된 결과를 바탕으로 다시 높은 트래픽으로 성능을 테스트했습니다. 기존과 환경은 동일하게 구성하고 같은 양의 부하 발생기를 사용했습지만, 응답 시간이 짧아짐에 따라서 더 많은 트래픽이 발생했습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"d2-11\"></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"d2-12\"></p>\n\n<p>실험 결과를 정리해보면 다음과 같습니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>CPU 사용률은 약 17%(234qps)</li>\n<li>평균 응답 시간은 약 14ms, p99 응답 시간은 약 37ms</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>이를 바탕으로 서빙에 필요한 리소스를 다시 산정해 보겠습니다. 해당 서버가 받아야 하는 트래픽은 위에 언급했듯이 2500qps이고, 인스턴스당 CPU 사용률 기준은 30% 이하입니다. CPU 사용률 1%당 약13.8qps를 받을 수 있으며, 30%의 사용률은 약 414qps입니다. 인스턴스 1대당 414 qps를 받을 수 있으므로 필요한 서버는 최소 6대 이상입니다.

JetBrains의 PyCharm이 Yappi를 기본 프로파일러로 채택했을 만큼, 신뢰성과 안정성은 이미 검증되었습니다. 여러분도 최소한의 노력과 시간만으로도 예상 이상의 성과를 얻을 수 있습니다.</p>",

    "title": "Poking at the CSS if() Function a Little More: Conditional Color Theming",
    "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/137\">Chrome 137</a> shipped the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals/\"><code>if()</code> CSS function</a>, so it’s totally possible we’ll see other browsers implement it, though it’s tough to know exactly when. Whatever the case, <code>if()</code> enables us to use values conditionally, which we can already do with queries and other functions (e.g., media queries and the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/light-dark/\"><code>light-dark()</code></a> function), so I’m sure you’re wondering: What exactly does <code>if()</code> do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/lightly-poking-at-the-css-if-function-in-chrome-137/\">Sunkanmi gave us a nice overview of the function yesterday</a>, poking at the syntax at a high level. I’d like to poke at it a little harder in this article, getting into some possible real-world usage.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387215\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>To recap, <code>if()</code> conditionally assigns a value to a property based on the value of a CSS variable. For example, we could assign different values to the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/c/color/\"><code>color</code></a> and <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/\"><code>background</code></a> properties based on the value of <code>--theme</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>--theme</code>: <code>\"Shamrock\"</code>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>color</code>: <code>‌hsl(146 50% 3%)</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>background</code>: <code>hsl(146 50% 40%)</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>--theme</code>: Anything else\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>color</code>: <code>hsl(43 74% 3%)</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>background</code>: <code>hsl(43 74% 64%)</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>:root {\n  /* Change to fall back to the ‘else’ values */\n  --theme: \"Shamrock\";\n\n  body {\n    color: if(style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 3%); else: hsl(43 74% 3%));\n    background: if(style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 40%); else: hsl(43 74% 64%));\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t love the syntax (too many colons, brackets, and so on), but we can format it like this (which I think is a bit clearer):</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>color: if(\n  style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 3%);\n  else: hsl(43 74% 3%)\n);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We should be able to do a crazy number of things with <code>if()</code>, and I hope that becomes the case eventually, but I did some testing and learned that the syntax above is the only one that works. We can’t base the condition on the value of an ordinary CSS property (instead of a custom property), HTML attribute (using <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/a/attr/\"><code>attr()</code></a>), or any other value. For now, at least, the condition must be based on the value of a custom property (CSS variable).</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"exploring-what-we-can-do-with-if-\">Exploring what we can do with <code>if()</code></h3>\n\n\n<p>Judging from that first example, it’s clear that we can use <code>if()</code> for theming (and design systems overall). While we could utilize the <code>light-dark()</code> function for this, what if the themes aren’t strictly light and dark, or what if we want to have more than two themes or light and dark modes for each theme? Well, that’s what <code>if()</code> can be used for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, let’s create more themes/more conditions:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>:root {\n  /* Shamrock | Saffron | Amethyst */\n  --theme: \"Saffron\"; /* ...I choose you! */\n\n  body {\n    color: if(\n      style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 3%);\n      style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): hsl(43 74% 3%);\n      style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): hsl(282 47% 3%)\n    );\n    background: if(\n      style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): hsl(146 50% 40%);\n      style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): hsl(43 74% 64%);\n      style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): hsl(282 47% 56%)\n    );\n    transition: 300ms;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty simple really, but there are a few easy-to-miss things. Firstly, there’s no “else condition” this time, which means that if the theme isn’t <code>Shamrock</code>, <code>Saffron</code>, or <code>Amethyst</code>, the default browser styles are used. Otherwise, the <code>if()</code> function <em>resolves to the value of the first true statement</em>, which is the <code>Saffron</code> theme in this case. Secondly, transitions work right out of the box; in the demo below, I’ve added a user interface for toggling the <code>--theme</code>, and for the transition, <em>literally</em> just <code>transition: 300ms</code> alongside the <code>if()</code> functions:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Note:</strong> if theme-swapping is user-controlled, such as selecting an option, you don’t actually need <code>if()</code> at all. You can just use the logic that I’ve used at the beginning of the demo (<code>:root:has(#shamrock:checked) { /* Styles */ }</code>). Amit Sheen has an <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/05/combining-css-has-html-select-conditional-styling/\">excellent demonstration over at Smashing Magazine</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the code more maintainable though, we can slide the colors into CSS variables as well, then use them in the <code>if()</code> functions, <em>then</em> slide the <code>if()</code> functions themselves into CSS variables:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* Setup */\n:root {\n  /* Shamrock | Saffron | Amethyst */\n  --theme: \"Shamrock\"; /* ...I choose you! */\n\n  /* Base colors */\n  --shamrock: hsl(146 50% 40%);\n  --saffron: hsl(43 74% 64%);\n  --amethyst: hsl(282 47% 56%);\n\n  /* Base colors, but at 3% lightness */\n  --shamrock-complementary: hsl(from var(--shamrock) h s 3%);\n  --saffron-complementary: hsl(from var(--saffron) h s 3%);\n  --amethyst-complementary: hsl(from var(--amethyst) h s 3%);\n\n  --background: if(\n    style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): var(--shamrock);\n    style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): var(--saffron);\n    style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): var(--amethyst)\n  );\n\n  --color: if(\n    style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): var(--shamrock-complementary);\n    style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): var(--saffron-complementary);\n    style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): var(--amethyst-complementary)\n  );\n\n  /* Usage */\n  body {\n    /* One variable, all ifs! */\n    background: var(--background);\n    color: var(--color);\n    accent-color: var(--color);\n\n    /* Can’t forget this! */\n    transition: 300ms;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as using CSS variables within the <code>if()</code> function, we can also nest other functions. In the example below, I’ve thrown <code>light-dark()</code> in there, which basically inverts the colors for dark mode:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>--background: if(\n  style(--theme: \"Shamrock\"): light-dark(var(--shamrock), var(--shamrock-complementary));\n  style(--theme: \"Saffron\"): light-dark(var(--saffron), var(--saffron-complementary));\n  style(--theme: \"Amethyst\"): light-dark(var(--amethyst), var(--amethyst-complementary))\n);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"-if-vs-container-style-queries\"><code>if()</code> vs. Container style queries</h3>\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t used <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-container-queries/#aa-container-style-queries\">container style queries</a> before, they basically check if a container has a certain CSS variable (much like the <code>if()</code> function). Here’s the exact same example/demo but with container style queries instead of the <code>if()</code> function:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>:root {\n  /* Shamrock | Saffron | Amethyst */\n  --theme: \"Shamrock\"; /* ...I choose you! */\n\n  --shamrock: hsl(146 50% 40%);\n  --saffron: hsl(43 74% 64%);\n  --amethyst: hsl(282 47% 56%);\n\n  --shamrock-complementary: hsl(from var(--shamrock) h s 3%);\n  --saffron-complementary: hsl(from var(--saffron) h s 3%);\n  --amethyst-complementary: hsl(from var(--amethyst) h s 3%);\n\n  body {\n    /* Container has chosen Shamrock! */\n    @container style(--theme: \"Shamrock\") {\n      --background: light-dark(var(--shamrock), var(--shamrock-complementary));\n      --color: light-dark(var(--shamrock-complementary), var(--shamrock));\n    }\n\n    @container style(--theme: \"Saffron\") {\n      --background: light-dark(var(--saffron), var(--saffron-complementary));\n      --color: light-dark(var(--saffron-complementary), var(--saffron));\n    }\n\n    @container style(--theme: \"Amethyst\") {\n      --background: light-dark(var(--amethyst), var(--amethyst-complementary));\n      --color: light-dark(var(--amethyst-complementary), var(--amethyst));\n    }\n\n    background: var(--background);\n    color: var(--color);\n    accent-color: var(--color);\n    transition: 300ms;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, where <code>if()</code> facilitates conditional values, container style queries facilitate conditional properties <em>and</em> values. Other than that, it really is just a different syntax.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"additional-things-you-can-do-with-if-but-might-not-realize-\">Additional things you can do with <code>if()</code> (but might not realize)</h3>\n\n\n<p>Check if a CSS variable exists:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* Hide icons if variable isn’t set */\n.icon {\n  display: if(\n    style(--icon-family): inline-block;\n    else: none\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Create more-complex conditional statements:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>h1 {\n  font-size: if(\n    style(--largerHeadings: true): xxx-large;\n    style(--theme: \"themeWithLargerHeadings\"): xxx-large\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Check if two CSS variables match:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* If #s2 has the same background as #s1, add a border */\n#s2 {\n  border-top: if(\n    style(--s2-background: var(--s1-background)): thin solid red\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"-if-and-calc-when-the-math-isn-t-mathing\"><code>if()</code> and <code>calc()</code>: When the math isn’t mathing</h3>\n\n\n<p>This won’t work (maybe someone can help me pinpoint why):</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>div {\n  /* 3/3 = 1 */\n  --calc: calc(3/3);\n  /* Blue, because if() won’t calculate --calc */\n  background: if(style(--calc: 1): red; else: blue);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To make <code>if()</code> calculate <code>--calc</code>, we’ll need to register the CSS variable using <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/p/property/\">@property</a></code> first, like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>@property --calc {\n  syntax: \"\";\n  initial-value: 0;\n  inherits: false;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"closing-thoughts\">Closing thoughts</h3>\n\n\n<p>Although I’m not keen on the syntax and how unreadable it can sometimes look (especially if it’s formatted on one line), I’m mega excited to see how <code>if()</code> evolves. I’d love to be able to use it with ordinary properties (e.g., <code>color: if(style(background: white): black; style(background: black): white);</code>) to avoid having to set CSS variables where possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’d also be awesome if <code>calc()</code> calculations could be calculated on the fly without having to register the variable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, I’m still super happy with what <code>if()</code> does currently, and can’t wait to build even simpler design systems.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><small><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/poking-at-the-css-if-function-a-little-more-conditional-color-theming/\">Poking at the CSS if() Function a Little More: Conditional Color Theming</a> originally published on <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com\">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is part of the <a href=\"https://try.digitalocean.com/css-tricks/?utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_source=css-tricks.com&amp;utm_campaign=family_&amp;utm_content=\">DigitalOcean</a> family.

    "title": "Lightly Poking at the CSS if() Function in Chrome 137",
    "content": "\n<p>We’ve known it for a few weeks now, but the CSS <code>if()</code> function <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/quick-hit-49/\">officially shipped in Chrome 137 version</a>. It’s really fast development for a feature that <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals/\">the CSSWG resolved to add less than a year ago</a>. We can typically expect this sort of thing — especially one that is unlike anything we currently have in CSS — to develop over a number of years before we can get our dirty hands on it. But here we are!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not here to debate whether&nbsp;<code>if()</code>&nbsp;in CSS should exist, nor do I want to answer whether CSS is a programming language;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/is-css-a-programming-language/\">Chris already did that</a>&nbsp;and definitely explained how exhausting that <em>fun </em>little argument can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I <em>am</em> here to do is poke at&nbsp;<code>if()</code>&nbsp;in these early days of support and explore what we know about it today at a pretty high level to get a feel for its syntax. <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/poking-at-the-css-if-function-a-little-more-conditional-color-theming/\">We poke a little harder at it in another post</a> where we’ll look at a more heady real-world example.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-387422\"></span>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"it-s-finally-here-\">Yes, it’s already here!</h3>\n\n\n<p>Conditional statements exist everywhere in CSS. From at-rules to the parsing and matching of every statement to the DOM, CSS has always had conditionals. And, <a href=\"https://lea.verou.me/blog/2024/css-conditionals/\">as Lea Verou put it</a>,&nbsp;every selector is essentially a conditional!&nbsp;What we haven’t had, however, is a way to style an element against multiple conditions in one line, and then have it return a result&nbsp;<em>conditionally</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>if()</code>&nbsp;function is a more advanced level of conditionals, where you can manipulate and have all your conditional statements assigned to a single property.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.element {\n  color: if(style(--theme: dark): oklch(52% 0.18 140); else: oklch(65% 0.05 220));\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-does-if-work-\">How does <code>if()</code> work?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Well before Chrome implemented the feature, back in 2021 when it was first proposed, the early syntax was like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code> = if( , []{1, 2} )</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we’re looking at this instead:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code> = if(\n  [: ]*;\n  :  ;?\n)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Where…</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The first&nbsp;<code></code>&nbsp;represents conditions inside either&nbsp;<code>style()</code>,&nbsp;<code>media()</code>, or&nbsp;<code>supports()</code>&nbsp;wrapper functions. This allows us to write multiple if statements, as many as we may desire. Yes, you read that right. As many as we want!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The final&nbsp;<code></code>&nbsp;condition (<code>else</code>) is the default value when all other if statements fail.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the “easy” way to read the syntax. This is what’s <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-5/#if-notation\">in the spec</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code> = if( [  ; ]*  ;? )\n =  : ?\n =  ]&gt; | else\n =\n  supports( [  :  ] |  )\n  media(  |  ) |\n  style(  )</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>A little wordy, right? So, let’s look at an example to wrap our heads around it. Say we want to change an element’s padding depending on a given active color scheme. We would set an <code>if()</code> statement with a&nbsp;<code>style()</code>&nbsp;function inside, and that would compare a given value with something like a custom variable to output a result. All this talk sounds so complicated, so let’s jump into code:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.element {\n  padding: if(style(--theme: dark): 2rem; else: 3rem);\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The example above sets the padding to&nbsp;<code>2rem</code>…&nbsp;<em>if</em>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<code>--theme</code>&nbsp;variable is set to <code>dark</code>. <em>If</em> not, it defaults to&nbsp;<code>3rem</code>. I know, not exactly the sort of thing you might actually use the function for, but it’s merely to illustrate the basic idea.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"make-the-syntax-clean-\">Make the syntax clean!</h3>\n\n\n<p>One thing I noticed, though, is that things can get convoluted very&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;fast. Imagine you have three <code>if()</code> statements like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>:root {\n  --height: 12.5rem;\n  --width: 4rem;\n  --weight: 2rem;\n}\n\n.element {\n  height: if(\n    style(--height: 3rem): 14.5rem; style(--width: 7rem): 10rem; style(--weight: 100rem): 2rem; else: var(--height)\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re only working with three statements and, I’ll be honest, it makes my eyes hurt with complexity. So, I’m anticipating&nbsp;<code>if()</code>&nbsp;style patterns to be developed soon or <em>prettier</em> versions to adopt a formatting style for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if I were to break things out to be more readable, I would likely do something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>:root {\n  --height: 12.5rem;\n  --width: 4rem;\n  --weight: 2rem;\n}\n\n/* This is much cleaner, don't you think? */\n.element {\n  height: if(\n    style(--height: 3rem): 14.5rem; \n    style(--width: 7rem): 10rem; \n    style(--weight: 100rem): 2rem; \n    else: var(--height)\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Much better, right? Now, you can definitely understand what is going on at a glance. That’s just me, though. Maybe you have different ideas… and <em>if</em> you do, I’d love to see them in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a quick demo showing multiple conditionals in CSS for this animated ball to work. The width of the ball changes based on some custom variable values set. Gentle reminder that this is only supported in Chrome 137+ at the time I’m writing this:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-do-supports-and-media-work-in-if-\">The <code>supports()</code> and <code>media()</code> statements</h3>\n\n\n<p>Think of&nbsp;<code>supports()</code>&nbsp;the same way you would use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/s/supports/\"><code>@supports</code></a>&nbsp;at-rule. In fact, they work about the same, at least conceptually:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* formal syntax for @supports */\n@supports  {\n  \n}\n\n/* formal syntax for supports() */\nsupports( [  :  ] |  )</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The only difference here is that <code>supports()</code> returns a value instead of matching a block of code. But, how does this work in&nbsp;<em>real code?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The&nbsp;<code>: </code>&nbsp;you see here is, in this case, the&nbsp;<strong>property name: property value</strong>&nbsp;e.g.&nbsp;<code>display: flex</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you want to check for support for the&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/backdrop-filter/\">backdrop-filter</a></code>&nbsp;property, particularly the&nbsp;<code>blur()</code>&nbsp;function. Typically, you can do this with&nbsp;<code>@supports</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* Fallback in case the browser doesn't support backdrop-filter */\n.card {\n  backdrop-filter: unset;\n  background-color: oklch(20% 50% 40% / 0.8);\n}\n\n@supports (backdrop-filter: blur(10px)) {\n  .card {\n    backdrop-filter: blur(10px);\n    background-color: oklch(20% 50% 40% / 0.8);\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But, with CSS&nbsp;<code>if()</code>, we can also do this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.card {\n  backdrop-filter: if(\n    supports(backdrop-filter: blur(10px)): blur(10px);\n    else: unset\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\"><strong>Note:</strong> Think of <code>unset</code> here as a possible fallback for graceful degradation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That looks awesome, right? Multiple conditions can be checked as well for&nbsp;<code>supports()</code>&nbsp;and any of the supported functions. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>.card {\n  backdrop-filter: if(\n    supports(backdrop-filter: blur(10px)): blur(10px);\n    supports(backdrop-filter: invert(50%)): invert(50%);\n    supports(backdrop-filter: hue-rotate(230deg)): hue-rotate(230deg);;\n    else: unset\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, take a look at the&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/rules/m/media/\">@media</a></code> at-rule.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/\">You can compare and check for a bunch of stuff</a>, but I’d like to keep it simple and check for whether or not a screen size is a certain width and apply styles based on that:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>h1 {\n  font-size: 2rem;\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\n  h1 {\n    font-size: 2.5rem;\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 1200px) {\n  h1 {\n    font-size: 3rem;\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<code>media()</code>&nbsp;wrapper works almost the same way as its at-rule counterpart. Note its syntax from the spec:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>/* formal syntax for @media */\n@media  {\n  \n}\n\n/* formal syntax for media() */\nmedia(  |  )</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Notice how at the&nbsp;<em>end of the day</em>, the formal syntax (<code></code>) is the same as the syntax for the&nbsp;<code>media()</code>&nbsp;function. And instead of returning a block of code in&nbsp;<code>@media</code>, you’d have something like this in the CSS inline&nbsp;<code>if()</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-css\" data-line=\"\"><code>h1 {\n  font-size: if(\n    media(width &gt;= 1200px): 3rem;\n    media(width &gt;= 768px): 2.5rem;\n    else: 2rem\n  );\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-is-browser-support-for-if-\">Again, these are early days</h3>\n\n\n<p>As of the time of this writing, only the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://caniuse.com/?search=if(\">latest update of Chrome supports&nbsp;<code>if()</code></a>). I’m guessing other browsers will follow suit once usage and interest come in. I have no idea when that will happen. Until then, I think it’s fun to experiment with this stuff, just as others have been doing:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/the-what-if-machine-bringing-the-iffy-future-of-css-into-the-present/\">The What If Machine: Bringing the “Iffy” Future of CSS into the Present</a> (Lee Meyer)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://css-tip.com/inline-if/\">How To Correctly Use <code>if()</code> In CSS</a> (Temani Afif)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.kizu.dev/future-proofing-indirect-cyclic-conditions/\">Future-Proofing Indirect Cyclical Conditions</a> (Roma Komarov)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amitmerchant.com/the-if-function-in-css/\">The new <code>if()</code> function in CSS has landed in the latest Chrome</a> (Amit Merchant)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Experimenting with early features is how we help CSS evolve.

USB가 컴퓨터와 주변기기들을 간편하게 연결할 수 있는 표준을 만들었던 것처럼, MCP는 AI 모델과 다양한 환경이 자연스럽게 연결될 수 있도록 돕습니다. MCP 덕분에 하나의 서버에서 다양한 AI 툴(예: Cursor, Claude, Windsurf 등)을 편하게 사용할 수 있게 되는 것이죠. 저희는 MCP를 활용해, 개발자들이 더 쉽고 즐겁게 작업할 수 있는 '바이브 코딩' 환경을 만들려고 하고 있어요.</span></span></span></p><p

    "content": "\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/a-better-api-for-the-resize-observer/\">previous article</a>, I showed you how to refactor the Resize Observer API into something way simpler to use:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>// From this\nconst observer = new ResizeObserver(observerFn)\n\nfunction observerFn (entries) {\n  for (let entry of entries) {\n    // Do something with each entry\n  }\n}\n\nconst element = document.querySelector('#some-element')\nobserver.observe(element);</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>// To this \nconst node = document.querySelector('#some-element')\nconst obs = resizeObserver(node, {\n  callback({ entry }) {\n    // Do something with each entry\n  }\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we’re going to do the same for <code>MutationObserver</code> and <code>IntersectionObserver</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-386344\"></span>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"refactoring-mutationobserver\">Refactoring Mutation Observer</h3>\n\n\n<p><code>MutationObserver</code> has almost the same API as that of <code>ResizeObserver</code>. So we can practically copy-paste the entire chunk of code we wrote for <code>resizeObserver</code> to <code>mutationObserver</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>export function mutationObserver(node, options = {}) {\n  const observer = new MutationObserver(observerFn)\n  const { callback, ...opts } = options\n  observer.observe(node, opts)\n\n  function observerFn(entries) {\n    for (const entry of entries) {\n      // Callback pattern\n      if (options.callback) options.callback({ entry, entries, observer })\n      // Event listener pattern\n      else {\n        node.dispatchEvent(\n          new CustomEvent('mutate', {\n            detail: { entry, entries, observer },\n          })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>You can now use <code>mutationObserver</code> with the <code>callback</code> pattern or event listener pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>const node = document.querySelector('.some-element')\n\n// Callback pattern \nconst obs = mutationObserver(node, {\n  callback ({ entry, entries }) {\n    // Do what you want with each entry\n  }\n})\n\n// Event listener pattern\nnode.addEventListener('mutate', event =&gt; {\n  const { entry } = event.detail\n  // Do what you want with each entry\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Much easier!</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disconnecting-the-observer\">Disconnecting the observer</h4>\n\n\n<p>Unlike <code>ResizeObserver</code> who has two methods to stop observing elements, <code>MutationObserver</code> only has one, the <code>disconnect</code> method.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>export function mutationObserver(node, options = {}) {\n  // ... \n  return {\n    disconnect() {\n      observer.disconnect()\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>But,&nbsp;<code>MutationObserver</code>&nbsp;has a&nbsp;<code>takeRecords</code>&nbsp;method that lets you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver/takeRecords#examples\">get unprocessed records</a>&nbsp;before you disconnect. Since we should <code>takeRecords</code> before we <code>disconnect</code>, let’s use it inside <code>disconnect</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create a complete API, we can return this method as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>export function mutationObserver(node, options = {}) {\n  // ... \n  return {\n    // ...\n    disconnect() {\n      const records = observer.takeRecords()\n      observer.disconnect()\n      if (records.length &gt; 0) observerFn(records)\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we can disconnect our mutation observer easily with <code>disconnect</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>const node = document.querySelector('.some-element')\nconst obs = mutationObserver(/* ... */)\n\nobs.disconnect()</code></pre>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mutationobserver-s-observe-options\">MutationObserver’s observe options</h4>\n\n\n<p>In case you were wondering, <code>MutationObserver</code>’s <code>observe</code> method can take in 7 <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver/observe#options\">options</a>. Each one of them determines what to observe, and they all default to <code>false</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>subtree</code>: Monitors the entire subtree of nodes</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>childList</code>: Monitors for addition or removal children elements. If <code>subtree</code> is <code>true</code>, this monitors all descendant elements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>attributes</code>: Monitors for a change of attributes</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>attributeFilter</code>: Array of specific attributes to monitor</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>attributeOldValue</code>: Whether to record the previous attribute value if it was changed</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>characterData</code>: Monitors for change in character data</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>characterDataOldValue</code>: Whether to record the previous character data value</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"refactoring-intersection-observer\">Refactoring Intersection Observer</h3>\n\n\n<p>The API for <code>IntersectionObserver</code> is similar to other observers. Again, you have to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Create a new observer:</strong> with the <code>new</code> keyword. This observer takes in an observer function to execute.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Do something with the observed changes:</strong> This is done via the observer function that is passed into the observer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Observe a specific element:</strong> By using the <code>observe</code> method.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>(Optionally) unobserve the element:</strong> By using the <code>unobserve</code> or <code>disconnect</code> method (depending on which Observer you’re using).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>But <code>IntersectionObserver</code> requires you to pass the options in Step 1 (instead of Step 3). So here’s the code to use the <code>IntersectionObserver</code> API.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>// Step 1: Create a new observer and pass in relevant options\nconst options = {/*...*/}\nconst observer = new IntersectionObserver(observerFn, options)\n\n// Step 2: Do something with the observed changes\nfunction observerFn (entries) {\n  for (const entry of entries) {\n    // Do something with entry\n  }\n}\n\n// Step 3: Observe the element\nconst element = document.querySelector('#some-element')\nobserver.observe(element)\n\n// Step 4 (optional): Disconnect the observer when we're done using it\nobserver.disconnect(element)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the code is similar, we can also copy-paste the code we wrote for <code>mutationObserver</code> into <code>intersectionObserver</code>. When doing so, we have to remember to pass the options into <code>IntersectionObserver</code> and not the <code>observe</code> method.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"2,3\"><code>export function mutationObserver(node, options = {}) {\n  const { callback, ...opts } = options\n  const observer = new MutationObserver(observerFn, opts)\n  observer.observe(node)\n\n  function observerFn(entries) {\n    for (const entry of entries) {\n      // Callback pattern\n      if (options.callback) options.callback({ entry, entries, observer })\n      // Event listener pattern\n      else {\n        node.dispatchEvent(\n          new CustomEvent('intersect', {\n            detail: { entry, entries, observer },\n          })\n        )\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we can use <code>intersectionObserver</code> with the same easy-to-use API:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-csstricks-code-block language-javascript\" data-line=\"\"><code>const node = document.querySelector('.some-element')\n\n// Callback pattern \nconst obs = intersectionObserver(node, {\n  callback ({ entry, entries }) {\n    // Do what you want with each entry\n  }\n})\n\n// Event listener pattern\nnode.addEventListener('intersect', event =&gt; {\n  const { entry } = event.detail\n  // Do what you want with each entry\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"disconnecting-the-intersection-observer\">Disconnecting the Intersection Observer</h4>\n\n\n<p><code>IntersectionObserver</code>‘s methods are a union of both <code>resizeObserver</code> and <code>mutationObserver</code>.

    "content": "\n<p>I have had the opportunity to edit over a lot of the new color entries coming to the <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/\">CSS-Tricks Almanac</a>. We’ve already published several with more on the way, including a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/css-color-functions/\">complete guide on color functions</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/c/color/\">color()</a></code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/h/hsl/\">hsl()</a></code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/lab/\">lab()</a></code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/lch/\">lch()</a></code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklab/\">oklab()</a></code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklch/\">oklch()</a></code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/r/rgb/\">rgb()</a></code></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And I must admit: I didn’t know a lot about color in CSS (I still used&nbsp;<code>rgb()</code>, which apparently isn’t what cool people do anymore), so it has been a fun learning experience. One of the things I noticed while trying to keep up with all this new information was how long the glossary of color goes, especially the&nbsp;“color”&nbsp;concepts. There are “color spaces,” “color models,” “color gamuts,” and basically a “color” something for everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are all somewhat related, and it can get confusing as you dig into using color in CSS, especially the new color functions that have been shipped lately, like <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/exploring-the-css-contrast-color-function-a-second-time/\">contrast-color()</a></code> and <code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/color-mixing-with-animation-composition/\">color-mix()</a></code>. Hence, I wanted to make the glossary I wish I had when I was hearing for the first time about each concept, and that anyone can check whenever they forget what a specific “color” thing is.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-386925\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>As a disclaimer, I am not trying to explain color, or specifically, color reproduction, in this post; that would probably be impossible for a mortal like me. Instead, I want to give you a big enough picture for some technicalities behind color in CSS, such that you feel confident using functions like&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/l/lab/\">lab()</a></code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/o/oklch/\">oklch()</a></code>&nbsp;while also understanding what makes them special.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"what-s-a-color-\">What’s a color?</h3>\n\n\n<p>Let’s slow down first. In order to understand&nbsp;<em>everything</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>color</em>, we first need to understand the&nbsp;<em>color</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"footnote-1\">While it’s useful to think about an object being a certain color (watch out for the&nbsp;<em>red</em>&nbsp;car, or cut the&nbsp;<em>white</em>&nbsp;cable!), color isn’t a physical property of objects, or even a tangible thing. Yes, we can characterize&nbsp;<em>light</em>&nbsp;as the main cause of color<sup><a>1</a></sup>, but it isn’t until visible light enters our eyes and is interpreted by our brains that we perceive a color. As said by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/xyz-rgb.html\">Elle Stone</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Light waves are out there in the world, but color happens in the interaction between light waves and the eye, brain, and mind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if color isn’t a physical thing, we still want to replicate it as reliably as possible, especially in the digital era. If we take a photo of a beautiful bouquet of lilies (like the one on my desk) and then display it on a screen, we expect to see the same colors in both the image and reality. However, “reality” here is a misleading term since, once again, the&nbsp;<em>reality</em>&nbsp;of color depends on the viewer. To solve this, we need to understand how light wavelengths (something measurable and replicable) create different color responses in viewers (something not so measurable).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, this task was already carried out 95 years ago by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE, by its French name). I wish I could get into the details of the experiment, but we haven’t gotten into our first color thingie yet. What’s important is that from these measurements, the CIE was able to map all the colors visible to the average human (in the experiment) to light wavelengths and describe them with only three values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"footnote-2\">Initially, those three primary values corresponded to the red, green, and blue wavelengths used in the experiment, and they made up the CIERGB&nbsp;<em>Color Space</em>, but researchers noticed that some colors required a negative wavelength<sup><a data-type=\"internal\" data-id=\"#note-2\">2</a></sup>&nbsp;to represent a visible color. To avoid that, a series of transformations were performed on the original CIERGB and the resulting color space was called CIEXYZ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new color space also has three values, X and Z represent the chromaticity of a color, while Y represents its luminance. Since it has three axes, it makes a 3D shape, but if we slice it such that its luminance is the same, we get all the visible colors for a given luminance in a figure you have probably seen before.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png?resize=742%2C789&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"xy chromaticitydiagram showing all visible colors\" class=\"wp-image-386928\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png?w=742&amp;ssl=1 742w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1.png?resize=282%2C300&amp;ssl=1 282w\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is called the&nbsp;<em>xy chromaticity</em> diagram&nbsp;and holds <em>all</em> the colors visible by the average human eye (based on the average viewer in the CIE 1931 experiment). Colors inside the shape are considered real, while those outside are deemed imaginary.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-spaces\">Color Spaces</h3>\n\n\n<p>The purpose of the last explanation was to reach the CIEXYZ&nbsp;Color Space&nbsp;concept, but what exactly is a “color space”? And why is the CIEXYZ&nbsp;<em>Color Space</em>&nbsp;so important?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CIEXYZ Color Space is a mapping from all the colors visible by the average human eye into a 3D coordinate system, so we only need three values to define a color. Then, a&nbsp;<strong>color space can be thought of as a general mapping of color</strong>, with no need to include every visible color, and it is usually defined through three values as well.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rgb-color-spaces\">RGB Color Spaces</h4>\n\n\n<p>The most well-known color spaces are the RGB color spaces (note the plural). As you may guess from the name, here we only need the amount of red, green, and blue to describe a color. And to describe an RGB color space, we only need to define its “reddest”, “greenest”, and “bluest” values<sup id=\"footnote-3\"><a>3</a></sup>. If we use coordinates going from 0 to 1 to define a color in the RGB color space, then:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>(1, 0, 0)</code>&nbsp;means the reddest color.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>(0, 1, 0)</code>&nbsp;means the greenest color.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>(0, 0, 1)</code>&nbsp;means the bluest color.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>However, “reddest”, “bluest”, and “greenest” are only arbitrary descriptions of color. What makes a color the “bluest” is up to each person. For example, which of the following colors do you think is the bluest?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1-1024x1024.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Different shades of blue\" class=\"wp-image-386929\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-1-1.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can guess, something like “bluest” is an appalling description. Luckily, we just have to look back at the CIEXYZ color space — it’s pretty useful! Here, we can define what we consider the reddest, greenest, and bluest colors just as coordinates inside the xy chromaticity diagram. That’s all it takes to create an RGB color space, and why there are so many!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png?resize=768%2C583&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"sRGV and WideGamutRGB in the xy chromaticity diagram\" class=\"wp-image-386930\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-2.png?resize=300%2C228&amp;ssl=1 300w\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: <a href=\"https://ninedegreesbelow.com/\">Elle Stone</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In CSS, the most used color space is the standard RGB (sRGB) color space, which, as you can see in the last image, leaves a lot of colors out. However, in CSS, we can use modern RGB color spaces with a lot more colors through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/almanac/functions/c/color/\"><code>color()</code></a>&nbsp;function, such as&nbsp;<code>display-p3</code>,&nbsp;<code>prophoto-rgb</code>, and&nbsp;<code>rec2020</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=1473%2C1194&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Comparing the shapes of various color spaces, including sRGB, Display P3, A98-RGB, Rec2020, and ProPhoto.\" class=\"wp-image-386931\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?w=1473&amp;ssl=1 1473w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=300%2C243&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=1024%2C830&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-7.png?resize=768%2C623&amp;ssl=1 768w\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Chrome Developer Team</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-explanation\">Notice how the ProPhoto RGB color space goes out of the visible color. This is okay. Colors outside are clamped; they aren’t new or invisible colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In CSS, besides sRGB, we have two more color spaces: the CIELAB color space and the Oklab color space. Luckily, once we understood what the CIEXYZ color space is, then these two should be simpler to understand. Let’s dig into that next.</p>\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cielab-and-oklab-color-spaces\">CIELAB and Oklab Color Spaces</h4>\n\n\n<p>As we saw before, the sRGB color space lacks many of the colors visible by the average human eye. And as modern screens got better at displaying more colors, CSS needed to adopt newer color spaces to fully take advantage of those newer displays. That wasn’t the only problem with sRGB — it also lacks perceptual uniformity, meaning that changes in the color’s chromaticity also change its perceived lightness. Check, for example, this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/high-definition-css-color-guide#overview\">demo by Adam Argyle</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cp-codepen-gutenberg-embed-block cp_embed_wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Created in 1976 by the CIE, CIELAB, derived from CIEXYZ, also encompasses all the colors visible by the human eye. It works with three coordinates: L&nbsp;for perceptual lightness, a&nbsp;for the amount of red-green, and b* for the amount of yellow-blue in the color.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lab-color-space.jpg?resize=726%2C450&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"A diagram in the shape of a sphere containing a range of colors that go from white to black vertically and green to blue to yellow to red horizontally.\" class=\"wp-image-386933\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lab-color-space.jpg?w=726&amp;ssl=1 726w, https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lab-color-space.jpg?resize=300%2C186&amp;ssl=1 300w\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Credit: Linshang Technology</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a way better perceptual uniformity than sRGB, but it still isn’t completely uniform, especially in gradients involving blue. For example, in the following white-to-blue gradient, CIELAB shifts towards purple.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/css-tricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-6.png?resize=592%2C192&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Comparing blue gradients in Oklahoma and CIELAB.

Oklab also uses the three&nbsp;<code>L*a*b*</code>&nbsp;coordinates. Thanks to all these improvements, it is the color space I try to use the most lately.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-models\">Color Models</h3>\n\n\n<p>When I was learning about these concepts, my biggest challenge after understanding color spaces was not getting them confused with color models and color gamuts. These two concepts, while complementary and closely related to color spaces, aren’t the same, so they are a common pitfall when learning about color.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <strong><dfn>color model</dfn></strong> refers to the mathematical description of color through tuples of numbers, usually involving three numbers, but these values don’t give us an exact color until we pair them with a color space. For example, you know that in the RGB color model, we define color through three values: red, green, and blue. However, it isn’t until we match it to an RGB color space (e.g., sRGB with&nbsp;display-p3) that we have a color. In this sense, a color space can have several color models, like sRGB, which uses RGB, HSL, and HWB. At the same time, a color model can be used in several color spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found plenty of articles and tutorials where “color spaces” and “color models” were used interchangeably. And some places were they had a different definition of color spaces and models than the one provided here. For example, Chrome’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/high-definition-css-color-guide#what_is_a_color_space\">High definition CSS color guide</a>&nbsp;defines CSS’s RGB and HSL as different color spaces, while MDN’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Color_space#rgb_color_spaces\">Color Space entry</a>&nbsp;does define RGB and HSL as part of the sRGB color space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, in CSS, I find it easier to understand the idea of RGB, HSL and HWB as different models to access the sRGB color space.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-gamuts\">Color Gamuts</h3>\n\n\n<p>A <strong><dfn>color gamut</dfn></strong> is more straightforward to explain. You may have noticed how we have talked about a color space having more colors than another, but it would be more correct to say it has&nbsp;a “wider” gamut, since a color gamut is the&nbsp;range of colors available in a color space. However, a color gamut isn’t only restricted by color space boundaries, but also by physical limitations. For example, an older screen may decrease the color gamut since it isn’t able to display each color available in a given color space. In this case where a color can’t be represented (due to physical limitation or being outside the color space itself), it’s said to be “out of gamut”.</p>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"color-functions\">Color Functions</h3>\n\n\n<p>In CSS, the only color space available used to be sRGB. Nowadays, we can work with a lot of modern color spaces through their respective color functions. As a quick reference, each of the color spaces in CSS uses the following functions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>sRGB:</strong>&nbsp;We can work in sRGB using the ol’ hexadecimal notation, named colors, and the&nbsp;<code>rgb()</code>,&nbsp;<code>rgba()</code>,&nbsp;<code>hsl()</code>,&nbsp;<code>hsla()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>hwb()</code>&nbsp;functions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CIELAB:</strong>&nbsp;Here we have the&nbsp;<code>lab()</code>&nbsp;for Cartesian coordinates and&nbsp;<code>lch()</code>&nbsp;for polar coordinates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Oklab:</strong>&nbsp;Similar to CIELAB, we have&nbsp;<code>oklab()</code>&nbsp;for Cartesian coordinates and&nbsp;<code>oklch()</code>&nbsp;for polar coordinates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More through the&nbsp;<code>color()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>color-mix()</code>.</strong>&nbsp;Outside these three color spaces, we can use many more using the&nbsp;<code>color()</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>color-mix()</code>&nbsp;functions. Specifically, we can use the RGB color spaces:&nbsp;<code>rgb-linear</code>,&nbsp;<code>display-p3</code>,&nbsp;<code>a98-rgb</code>,&nbsp;<code>prophoto-rgb</code>,&nbsp;<code>rec2020</code>&nbsp;and the XYZ color space:&nbsp;<code>xyz</code>,&nbsp;<code>xyz-d50</code>, or&nbsp;<code>xyz-d65</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tl-dr\">TL;DR</h3>\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Color spaces</strong> are a mapping between available colors and a coordinate system. In CSS, we have three main color spaces: sRGB, CIELAB, and Oklab, but many more are accessible through the&nbsp;<code>color()</code>&nbsp;function.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Color models</strong> define color with tuples of numbers, but they don’t give us information about the actual color until we pair them with a color space. For example, the RGB model doesn’t mean anything until we assign it an RGB color space.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Most of the time, we want to talk about how many colors a color space holds, so we use the term <strong>color gamut</strong> for the task. However, a color gamut is also tied to the physical limitations of a camera/display. A color may be out-of-gamut, meaning it can’t be represented in a given color space.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In CSS, <strong>we can access all these color spaces through color functions</strong>, of which there are many.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>CIEXYZ color space</strong> is extremely useful to define other color spaces, describe their gamuts, and convert between them.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"references\">References</h3>\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://ninedegreesbelow.com/photography/xyz-rgb.html\">Completely Painless Programmer’s Guide to XYZ, RGB, ICC, xyY, and TRCs</a>&nbsp;(Elle Stone)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://ciechanow.ski/color-spaces/\">Color Spaces</a> (Bartosz Ciechanowski)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"http://dougkerr.net/Pumpkin/articles/CIE_XYZ.pdf\">The CIE XYZ and xyY Color Spaces</a>(Douglas A.

Claude Code를 주로 사용하는데, 에이전트에 작업을 할당하고 대부분의 권한을 주어 작업을 완료할 수 있게 하고 있으면 대부분의 도구를 단순하게 유지하려고 하면 대체 서비스가 불안정할 때만 MCP를 사용하고 있다. 가능하다면 Go 언어의 사용을 강력히 추천하며 효과적인 도구를 같이 사용하는 것이 중요하며 빠른 도구를 사용하면 더 좋은 결과를 얻을 수 있고 의존성을 업그레이드할 때는 AI가 알아서 해줄 것이라는 유혹에 빠지지 말고 더 보수적으로 해야 한다고 경고한다. 그리고 AI의 발전이 아주 빨라서 이 권장 사항도 금방 유효하게 않아질 것이라고 얘기한다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.maxemitchell.com/writings/i-read-all-of-cloudflares-claude-generated-commits/\">I Read All Of Cloudflare's Claude-Generated Commits</a></strong> : Cloudflare에서 Claude로 작성해서 공개한 <a href=\"https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider\">OAuth 2.1 라이브러리</a>의 커밋을 읽고 생각을 정리한 글이다. 이 라이브러리는 Cluade Code로 주로 작성했는데 커밋에 Claude에 요청한 프롬프트 기록을 다 남겨두었고 사람이 개입한 커밋은 따로 올려서 이를 알 수 있게 했는데 Cloudflare의 수석 엔지니어인 Kenton Varda이 AI 회의론자로 시작했지만, 결과적으로 프로덕션에서 사용할 수 있는 라이브러리를 만들 수 있었다고 한다. 프롬프트를 통해 예제를 제공하고 명확한 상황을 설명하는 프롬프트가 꽤 도움이 되지만 커밋이 20개가 넘어가면서 사람의 개입이 점점 많아지게 되었다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neilmadden.blog/2025/06/06/a-look-at-cloudflares-ai-coded-oauth-library/\">A look at CloudFlare’s AI-coded OAuth library</a></strong> : 바로 윗글에서도 소개한 Cloudflare가 Claude Code로 작성한 OAuth 라이브러리를 IETF의 OAuth 워킹그룹에서도 활동하고 OAuth 제공업체의 기술 책임자인 사람이 코드를 읽어보고 평가한 글이다. 코드는 꽤 인상적이었지만 이해하기 어려운 CORS 헤더 설정이 있었고 표준 보안헤더가 부족했으며 OAuth 명세에 익숙지 않은 사람이 작성한 것처럼 인증을 잘못 구현하거나 편향된 토큰 ID를 생성하고 있었다고 한다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://jasone.github.io/2025/06/12/jemalloc-postmortem/\">jemalloc Postmortem</a></strong> : memory allocator <a href=\"https://jemalloc.net/\">jemalloc</a>을 20년간 개발한 Jason Evans가 직접 정리한 회고이다. 2004년에 Lyken 프로그래밍 언어를 작업하다가 메모리 할당기를 만들고 이를 FreeBSD에 통합하기 시작했다. 당시는 멀티 프로세스로의 전환이 이뤄지던 시기였고 FreeBSD에는 phkmalloc가 있었지만, 병렬 스레드를 제대로 지원하지 못했기에 jemalloc을 FreeBSD에 통합하기 시작했지만, 심각한 조각화 문제를 발견했고 이를 개선하기 위해 레이아웃 알고리즘을 완전히 변경했다. 2009년 Facebook에서 일하기 시작하면서 jemalloc에 계측이 부족하다는 것을 깨닫고 힙 프로파일링 기능을 구현하고 GitHub으로 저장소를 옮겨서 다른 사람들의 기여도 받기 시작한다. Facebook의 내부 사용으로 많은 개선을 하면서 Facebook 내부에서 jemalloc 팀을 꾸려서 jemalloc 개발을 할 수 있었고 Facebook을 떠난 후에도 해당 팀을 jemalloc을 계속 개발했다. 이후 Facebook의 분위기가 달라지면서 jemalloc에 대한 개발도 끊기게 되었고 오픈 소스이지만 다른 외부 주요 기여자를 확보하지 못해서 업스트림 개발도 멈추게 되었지만 가장 보람찬 프로젝트였다고 한다.(영어)<br>\n<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>인프라 관련</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-service-outage-june-12-2025/\">Cloudflare service outage June 12, 2025</a></strong> : 지난 6월 12일 Cloudflare 대부분의 서비스가 2시간 28분 동안 중단되는 장애가 발생했다. 이번 장애는 Cloudflare 대부분의 제품이 Workers KV 서비스에 의존하고 있는데 Workers KV 인프라의 일부가 타사 클라우드(상황상 GCP)의 의존하고 있었기에 타사 클라우드에 장애가 나면서 같이 장애가 났다. 근본 원인은 타사 클라우드의 장애가 원인이었지만 Cloudflare는 Workers KV에 단일 장애 지점이 없어야 했지만, 이 부분에서 놓친 부분이 있어서 Cloudflare까지 장애가 발생했다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/ow5i3PPK96RduMcb1SsW\">GCP Outage</a></strong> : Google Cloud 대부분의 서비스가 한국 기준 13일 3:51부터 11:18까지 제대로 동작하지 않는 대규모 장애가 발생했다. Google Cloud에는 API의 정책과 할당량을 확인하는 Service Control이 있고 Serive Control을 분산된 구조의 지역 서비스이지만 데이터스토어의 메타데이터는 전 세계로 복제되어 할당량 정책을 관리하는 구조이다. 5월 29일에 할당량 정책을 확인하는 추가 기능이 배포되고 이 바이너리에 널포인트 오류 문제가 포함되어 있었고 13일 3시 45분 정책 변경이 적용되었는데 이 정책에 의도치 않은 빈 필드가 포함되면서 바이너리가 널포인트에 도달하는 오류가 발생하게 되었다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/dash-2025-new-feature-roundup-keynote/\">DASH 2025: Guide to Datadog's newest announcements</a></strong> : Datadog의 기술 콘퍼런스인 Dash에서 AI 워크로드 모니터링 기능, 장기 로그를 싸게 저장하면서 쿼리할 수 있는 Flex Logs, 복잡한 데이터를 분석할 수 있는 Datadog Sheets, 개선된 Datadog Internal Developer Portal(IDP), 온콜을 도와주는 Bits AI SRE 등을 공개했다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.tkng.io/\">The Kubernetes Networking Guide</a></strong> : Kubernetes의 CNI, Ingress/Egress, 정책 등 네트워킹 컴포넌트를 학습할 수 있는 사이트이다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/06/05/introducing-gateway-api-inference-extension/\">Introducing Gateway API Inference Extension</a></strong> : LLM은 기존 웹 요청과는 달리 오리 실행되고 리소스 집약적이며 상태가 저장되는 경우가 많기 때문에 Kuberntes Gateway API에 추론 전용 라우팅 기능을 추가하는 Gateway API Inference 확장이 만들어졌다. 이 확장을 사용하면 Gateway 라우팅 뒤에 Inference Model API를 제공하고 InferencePool을 통해 제공 위치와 방법을 관리할 수 있다.(영어)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://supabase.com/blog/multigres-vitess-for-postgres\">Announcing Multigres: Vitess for Postgres</a></strong> : supabase에 Vitess의 공동 창시자인 Sugu가 합류해서 Postgres용 Vitess인 Multigres를 만들게 되었다.

기준으로 프런트엔드 개발에서 AI 도구가 얼마나 사용되고 있는지를 다양한 항목별로 정리한 설문 결과다. 코드 생성, 리팩토링, 문서 작성, 테스트 작성 등 개발 프로세스 전반에 걸쳐 AI가 어떻게 활용되고 있는지 시각적으로 잘 보여준다. 각 프레임워크별 AI 도구 사용 현황도 확인할 수 있어, 현재 AI 활용 흐름을 파악하는 데 참고하기 좋다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://blog.mgechev.com/2025/04/19/llm-first-web-framework/\">LLM-first Web Framework</a></h2><p>이 글은 LLM(대규모 언어 모델) 친화적인 웹 프레임워크를 설계하고 구현하는 과정을 다룬다. 기존 프레임워크에서 발생하는 문제(예: API 버전 불일치, 학습 데이터 부족)를 해결하기 위해 간단하면서도 익숙한 구문과 세밀한 반응성을 기반으로 한 새로운 디자인 접근 방식을 채택했다. 특히, Revolt를 기반으로 이 프레임워크를 설계했으며, 텍스트 노드와 속성값을 getter 함수로 호출하도록 변경하여 정적 값과 반응형 값을 동일하게 처리하도록 개선했다.</p><p><a

Angular나 React와 같은 일반적인 프레임워크로 변환하는 방법도 제안하며, 상호 운용성을 강화하는 가능성을 탐구한다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.wwt.com/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-deep-dive\">Model Context Protocol (MCP): A Deep

Here's How JIT (Just In Time) Compilation Makes It 100x Faster Instantly</a></h2><p>JavaScript는 동적이고 느슨한 타입 시스템을 가진 특성상 성능에서 불리할 수 있지만, 현대 JS 엔진의 JIT(Just-In-Time) 컴파일 덕분에 놀라운 최적화가 가능하다.</p><p>JS 엔진은 코드를 실행 중에 분석해 자주 실행되는 코드 경로를 확인하고, 이를 머신 코드로 최적화하여 실행 속도를 크게 향상시킨다. V8 엔진을 기준으로 보면, 코드 프로파일링 후 Sparkplug가 초기 컴파일을 수행하고, TurboFan은 심화된 최적화를 통해 반복문 해체, 타입 체크 제거 등을 진행한다. 만약 가정된 조건이 깨지면 디옵티마이징을 통해 다시 초기 상태로 돌아가게 된다.</p><p>이런 과정은 WebAssembly와 같은 정적 컴파일 기술과 JS의 미래에도 영향을 미칠 가능성이 있다.</p><h1>📦 코드와 도구</h1><h2><a href=\"https://same.new/\">Same</a></h2><p>\"Copy any UI\" 모토와 같이 입력창에 복제할 웹사이트 주소(또는 유형)를 입력하면 해당 웹사이트를 분석하고 필요한 개발 라이브러리와 기본 프로젝트 환경을 구성해 준다.</p><p>프롬프트를 입력해

렌더링을 지연시키는 주요 자원들을 식별하고, 이를 최적화하여 사용자 경험을 향상시키는 방법을 다루고 있다. 브라우저는 HTML, CSS, JavaScript 로드 순서와 속도가 페이지 로딩 시간에 큰 영향을 미친다. 특히 CSS는 렌더링을 차단하는데, 이를 개선하기 위해, CSS를 인라인으로 삽입하거나, 중요하지 않은 스타일 시트는 비동기로 로드하는 방법을 제시하였다.<br>예를 들어, JavaScript의 경우 <code>async</code>나 <code>defer</code> 속성을 활용하여 렌더링을 차단하지 않도록 조치할 수 있다.<br>다양한 최적화를 통해 페이지의 첫 번째 콘텐츠 표시 시간을 단축하고, 사용자 이탈을 방지할 수 있다. 글에서는 실제 사례를 통해 이러한 최적화가 어떻게 적용되는지 시각적으로 보여준다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.debugbear.com/blog/avoid-large-layout-shifts\">Avoid Large Layout Shifts</a></h2><p>웹 페이지에서 발생하는 큰 레이아웃 이동(CLS)을 방지하는 방법을 세 가지 실제 사례를 다룬다.</p><ol><li><p>이미지 로딩 시 크기를 명시하지 않으면 콘텐츠가 갑자기 이동할 수 있다. 이를 해결하려면 이미지 태그에 <code>width</code>와 <code>height</code> 속성을 지정하여 브라우저가 공간을 미리 예약하도록 해야 한다.</p></li><li><p>JavaScript 위젯이 로드되면서 기존 콘텐츠를 밀어내는 경우가 있다. 이때는 위젯의 컨테이너에 최소 높이(<code>min-height</code>)를 설정하여 레이아웃 이동을 방지할 수 있다.</p></li><li><p>웹 폰트 로딩 시 폴백 폰트와의 차이로 인해 텍스트 위치가 변할 수 있다. <code>font-display: swap</code> 속성을 사용하고, 폴백 폰트를 웹 폰트와 유사한 크기로 지정하여 이러한 이동을 최소화할 수 있다.</p></li></ol><p>이러한 방법들을 통해 프런트엔드 개발자는 사용자 경험을 저해하는 예기치 않은 레이아웃 이동을 효과적으로 줄일 수 있다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/ui-is-hell-four-function-calculators\">UI is hell: four-function

Svelte의 창시자 Rich Harrris는 이를 통해 개발자들이 복잡한 학습 없이도 생산성을 높일 수 있도록 했다고 밝혔다. 또한, 그는 현재의 소프트웨어가 전반적으로 불완전하다고 지적하며, Svelte 팀의 목표는 더 견고하고 접근성 높은 애플리케이션을 구축하는 데 있다고 강조했다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://eslint.org/blog/2025/02/eslint-css-support/\">ESLint CSS Support</a></h2><p>지난 <a href=\"https://github.com/naver/fe-news/blob/master/issues/2024-11.md#eslint-adds-support-for-json-and-markdown\">FE-News 11월 호</a>에서 ESLint가 Markdown 파일의 정적 분석을 지원한 것을 소개했다. 이제 CSS 파일을 대상으로도 문법 에러·코딩 컨벤션 등을 점검해볼 수 있게 되었다.

Norman Group은 대체 텍스트는 이미지의 시각적 설명이 아니라 의미와 목적에 중점을 둬야 한다고 주장한다. 대체 텍스트는 사용자가 이미지의 기능과 맥락을 이해하도록 돕는 역할을 해야 하며, 장식용 이미지는 빈 대체 텍스트(<code>alt=\"\"</code>)로 설정해 화면 읽기 프로그램의 방해를 줄여야 한다고 강조한다. 이러한 내용을 실제 사례를 통해 설명하며, 웹 접근성과 사용자 경험을 향상시키는 실질적인 가이드를 제공한다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-rHmWSZajc\">How React Compiler Performs on Real Code, React Advanced 2024</a></h2><div

데모를 통해 과정을 시각적으로 보여주는 점이 특히 흥미롭다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://cloudfour.com/thinks/generating-random-mazes-with-javascript/\">Generating Random Mazes with JavaScript</a></h2><div

href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/18/how-to-import-a-javascript-library/\">Importing a frontend Javascript library without a build system</a></h2><p>이 글은 JavaScript 라이브러리를 가져오는 다양한 방법을 소개하며, 빌드 시스템을 사용하지 않는 프로젝트에서도 안전하게 라이브러리를 import 하는 방법을 다룬다. ESM(ECMAScript Modules)과 CommonJS의 차이, import와 require의 사용법, 그리고 브라우저 환경과 Node.js 환경에서 차이를 명확히 설명한다.</p><blockquote><p>저자는 이전 블로그에서 간단한 사이트에서는 빌드 시스템을 사용하지 않는 것이 더 쉽다고 주장했다.<br><a href=\"https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/16/writing-javascript-without-a-build-system/\">https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/16/writing-javascript-without-a-build-system/</a></p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://www.rob.directory/blog/react-from-scratch\">Implementing React From Scratch</a></h2><p>이 글은 React의 내부 동작 원리를 직접 구현하며 이해할 수 있는 튜토리얼이다. React의 상태 관리, DOM 업데이트 등 저수준 메커니즘을 분석하고 재구현하면서, 라이브러리가 왜 특정 설계를 선택했는지에 대한 통찰을 제공한다. 직접 구축하는 과정을 통해 숨겨진 동작과 설계 의도를 체감할 수 있어 React를 깊이 이해하려는 개발자들에게 유익하다.</p><h1>📦 코드와 도구</h1><h2><a href=\"https://trynova.dev/blog/what-is-the-nova-javascript-engine\">NOVA</a></h2><p>NOVA는 Rust로 개발된 새로운 JavaScript 및 WebAssembly 엔진으로, 데이터를 숫자나 문자열 등 유형별로 벡터에 저장해 메모리 안전성과 효율성을 강화하고, 참조를 인덱스로 관리해 포인터 사용을 줄이는 등 데이터 지향적 설계를 통해 성능 최적화를 목표로 한다. 객체 데이터를 유형별로 분리해 불필요한 데이터 접근을 방지하며, Rust의 안정성과 성능을 활용해 메모리 취약점을 방지하는 데 초점을 맞췄다.</p><p>NOVA는 아직 개발 초기 단계로, ECMAScript 테스트 제품군(<a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/test262\">test262</a>)의 약 47%만 통과한 상태지만, 새로운 아키텍처와 설계 접근 방식으로 JavaScript 엔진 개발에 흥미로운 가능성을 제시한다. V8 같은 기존 엔진과 달리 메모리와 데이터 접근을 효율적으로 처리하도록 설계되어, 특히 IoT나 게임 스크립팅 같은 특정 환경에서 활용 가능성이 크다. NOVA의 발전과 활용 사례가 기대된다.</p><blockquote><p>다음 발표 영상에서 NOVA의 설계 철학과 기술적 세부 사항을 설명한다. </p><div id=\"youtube2-WKGo1k47eYQ\" class=\"youtube-wrap\" data-attrs=\"{\" data-component-name=\"Youtube2ToDOM\"><div class=\"youtube-inner\"></div></div></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/html-to-react-figma-by-ma/chgehghmhgihgmpmdjpolhkcnhkokdfp?authuser=0&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1&amp;ck_subscriber_id=2915906285\">HTML to React &amp; Figma by Magic Patterns</a></h2><p>이 도구는 HTML 요소를 React 컴포넌트나 Figma 디자인으로 변환해 주는 크롬 확장 프로그램이다.

Vite는 매주 1500만 다운로드를 기록하며 JavaScript 생태계의 필수 도구로 자리 잡았고, Vitest도 Jest를 대체하며 인기를 끌고 있다.<br>그러나, 다양한 도구의 결합으로 비효율성과 대규모 앱의 네트워크 오버헤드 문제가 발현되었고, 이를 해결하고자 통합 툴체인 개발을 위해 VoidZero를 설립하고, Oxc와 Rolldown을 개발하였다. Oxc는 빠르고 메모리 효율적이며, Rolldown은 대규모 프로젝트의 성능을 크게 개선할 수 있도록 설계되었다. 이를 통해 빠르고 일관성 있는 개발 환경을 제공하고, 통합된 툴체인을 구축하려는 비전을 발표했다.</p><p>총 43개의 세션들 중 인기 있는 5개 세션을 소개한다.</p><ul><li><p><a

생각할 수 있다.</p><p>토스 프런트엔드 리드들의 FP와 OOP에 대한 생각을 들어보자.</p><blockquote><p>모닥불은 토스에서 제작하는 프런트엔드 개발 유튜브 컨텐츠이다.</p><p>시리즈로 <a href=\"https://toss.tech/article/28334\">EP.1 토스에서 말하는 “가독성 좋은 코드” 란 무엇일까?</a>,

관리자인 TanStack Query(구 React Query)는 6개의 React 애플리케이션들 중 1개에서 사용될만큼 인기 있는 라이브러리로 서버 상태 관리를 간소화하여 <code>5 O'Clock Rule</code>을 해결한다.</p><p>이 규칙은 개발자가 문제에 대한 생각을 멈추고 5시에 집에 갈 수 있을 때까지 문제 해결을 위한 추상화 수준이 높아진다는 것을 의미한다.</p><p>TanStack Query는 단순한 데이터 불러오기 라이브러리가 아니라 React 애플리케이션에서 서버 상태 관리를 간소화하는 비동기 상태 관리자로 데이터 가져오기, 캐싱, 무효화 등의 복잡한 작업을 처리해 주어 개발자는 복잡한 use effect에 얽매이지 않고 애플리케이션에 집중할 수 있게 한다.</p><blockquote><p>[참고] React Query는 <a href=\"https://tanstack.com/blog/announcing-tanstack-query-v4\">TanStack Query로 v4부터 리브랜딩</a> 되었으며, 유사한 기능을 다른 프레임워크로 확장하기 위함이라고 이유를

왔다.</p><p>디자인 시스템이 잘 작동한다면, 개발 속도와 생산성을 높여 더 가치 있는 작업에 집중할 수 있다. 그러나 조직 전체의 디자인 시스템은 공통 솔루션을 활용해 개발하는 개인의 부담을 줄여주었지만, 조직 솔루션들은 아이러니하게 중복되는 패턴이 나타나게 된다.</p><blockquote><p>[참고] 글로벌 디자인 시스템의 다음 단계는 무엇일까?

소개한다.</p><pre><code>// Type casting 예제\n\nfunction example(arg: unknown) {\n  const num = arg as number; // TypeScript\n  const num = /** @type {number} */ arg; // JSDoc\n\n  ...\n}</code></pre><h2><a

사용하는 것은 어렵기 때문에, 패키지들도 <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports\">conditional exports</a>를 통해 두 모듈 시스템을 모두 지원해야 한다.</p><p>이 글은 저자가 CJS의 import를 위한 <code>require()</code>를 통해 ESM 모듈을 지원하기 위해 PR을 제출한 경험과 왜 자신의 PR 전에 이러한 시도가 더 빠르게 일어나지 않았는지 등에 대해 이야기한다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2024/03/javascript-engines-runtimes/\">What's the difference between JavaScript engines and JavaScript runtimes?</a></h2><p>\"JavaScript 엔진\"과 \"JavaScript 런타임\"은 유사해 보이며 \"JavaScript를 실행하는 프로그램\"이라는 의미로 혼용되어 사용되고 있는 것 같다. 또한 종종 V8, Node.js 등의 조합을 참조하여 혼용되기도 한다.</p><p>하지만 범위와 기능 면에서 JavaScript 엔진과 런타임 이 둘은 상당한 차이가 있다.</p><h2><a href=\"https://dev.gmarket.com/101\">백엔드 개발자의 험난한 React 캘린더 컴포넌트 만들기 대작전 (feat.

Ensure you operate under a non-root user account with sudo privileges to execute administrative commands safely.</p>\n<p>The system should be updated to the latest package versions for security and compatibility; use sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade to achieve this. Verify your server’s internet connection stability, as the installation and updates require downloading packages from repositories.</p>\n<p>Familiarize yourself with basic Linux commands and the terminal, as you’ll predominantly use the command-line interface for installation and management tasks. These preliminary steps are foundational, reducing potential hiccups during the PostgreSQL installation process.</p>\n<h2>Securing Your PostgreSQL Installation</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_185\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-185\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-185\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/installation-security-measure.jpg\" alt=\"installation security measure\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/installation-security-measure.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/installation-security-measure-300x200.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/installation-security-measure-768x512.jpg 768w\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-185\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: freepik.com</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Securing your PostgreSQL installation is paramount to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access. Begin by setting strong passwords for the PostgreSQL roles, particularly the default ‘postgres’ user, which is often targeted by attackers.</p>\n<p>Configure the pg_hba.conf file to control access to your database; specify which hosts are allowed to connect, and enforce the use of strong authentication methods. Regularly apply security patches and updates to the PostgreSQL server to mitigate vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>Consider setting up a firewall to restrict incoming connections to your server, allowing only specific IP addresses or networks to connect to the PostgreSQL port. Lastly, enable SSL encryption for connections to ensure data is securely transmitted over the network, safeguarding against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>\n<h2>Customizing PostgreSQL Configuration Files</h2>\n<p>PostgreSQL’s performance and behavior can be fine-tuned through its main configuration files: postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf. The postgresql.conf file allows you to adjust memory allocation, query planning, and runtime statistics collection, among other parameters, to optimize the database server for your specific workload.</p>\n<p>Proper tuning of these settings can significantly enhance system performance and resource utilization. The pg_hba.conf file controls client authentication and connection policies. It’s essential to understand the security implications of these settings; carefully configure which users and hosts can connect to which databases, and specify the authentication methods.</p>\n<p>Customizing these files requires a balance between performance, security, and resource management, tailored to your environment’s needs.</p>\n<h2>Backup and Recovery Strategies for PostgreSQL</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_186\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-186\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-186\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/computer-backup.jpg\" alt=\"computer backup\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/computer-backup.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/computer-backup-300x214.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/computer-backup-768x548.jpg 768w\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-186\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: freepik.com</figcaption></figure>\n<p>A robust backup and recovery strategy is crucial for any database management system, ensuring data integrity and availability in case of hardware failure, data corruption, or accidental deletion. PostgreSQL offers several backup methods, including SQL dumps, file system level backups, and continuous archiving with <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/pl/SSEPEK_11.0.0/ugref/src/tpc/db2z_pointintimerecovery.html?view=kc\">point-in-time recovery</a> (PITR).</p>\n<p>Regularly perform backups and store them in a secure, off-site location to prevent data loss. Test your recovery procedures periodically to ensure they are effective and can be executed within your desired recovery time objectives. Understanding the trade-offs between different backup methods in terms of performance, storage, and recovery speed is essential for choosing the best strategy for your needs.</p>\n<h2>Enhancing PostgreSQL with Extensions and Tools</h2>\n<p>PostgreSQL’s extensibility is one of its core strengths, allowing users to add new functionality through extensions. Popular extensions like PostGIS add support for geographic objects, enabling location-based queries and analysis, which is invaluable for applications requiring spatial data.</p>\n<p>pgAdmin provides a graphical interface for database management, making it accessible to those who prefer not to use the command line. Other tools and extensions can provide additional indexing types, full-text search capabilities, and foreign data wrappers to integrate data from other sources. Exploring the available extensions and tools can unlock new possibilities and enhance your PostgreSQL database’s capabilities to meet specific application needs.</p>\n<h2>PostgreSQL on Netherlands Dedicated Servers</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-187\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/postgresql-netherland.jpg\" alt=\"postgresql netherland\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/postgresql-netherland.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/postgresql-netherland-300x225.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/postgresql-netherland-768x576.jpg 768w\"></p>\n<p>The process of installing PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 18.04 extends seamlessly to dedicated servers in the Netherlands. With dedicated resources and enhanced control, deploying PostgreSQL on a Netherlands dedicated server further amplifies database performance and management capabilities.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the PostgreSQL installation on Ubuntu 18.04 transforms your Netherlands VPS into a robust database management powerhouse.

    "content": "<p>The cryptocurrencies are not only attracting investors anymore. Business are now aware of the benefits that blockchain technology can bring. That is the main reason why so many of them are now accepting and implementing new models, where the main result is a wide range of payment methods.</p>\n<p>Adding this as a feature on your website is not complicated. All you need to is to select a proper payment gateway, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cryptomus.com/\">Cryptomus</a>. In this article, I will share more insights about the benefits e-commerce will get from adding crypto payments.</p>\n<h2>How to Integrate Crypto Payments On a Website?</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_163\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-163\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-163 size-large\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-to-Integrate-Crypto-Payments-On-a-Website-741x572.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-to-Integrate-Crypto-Payments-On-a-Website-741x572.webp 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-to-Integrate-Crypto-Payments-On-a-Website-300x231.webp 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-to-Integrate-Crypto-Payments-On-a-Website-768x593.webp 768w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-to-Integrate-Crypto-Payments-On-a-Website-1536x1185.webp 1536w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-to-Integrate-Crypto-Payments-On-a-Website-2048x1580.webp 2048w\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-163\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: pacific54.com</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The first step is to select a method you will use to provide your customers with an option to use their e-wallets for payments.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose a Wallet: Start by selecting a reliable cryptocurrency wallet. Popular options include MetaMask, Coinbase, or Trust Wallet.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Explore Payment Gateways: Look into payment gateways that support crypto transactions. These gateways act as bridges between your website and the crypto network. CoinGate, BitPay, and Coinbase Commerce are well-known options, along with with Cryptomus we already mentioned before.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Generate Payment Addresses: Create unique wallet addresses for your website. Each product or service can have its own address.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Display Payment Options: On your checkout page, add a “Pay with Crypto” button. When users click it, they’ll be directed to the payment gateway. Provide clear instructions for sending funds to the designated address.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor Transactions: Regularly check your wallet and the payment gateway for incoming payments. Most gateways notify you when funds arrive.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Confirm Transactions: Once confirmed, update your website to reflect successful payments. Send order confirmations to customers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Main Benefits</h2>\n<h3>Improved Security</h3>\n<p>Unlike traditional payment methods, where sensitive information is vulnerable, crypto transactions remain confidential. Whether you’re buying goods online or transferring funds globally, the blockchain ensures transparency and immutability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immutable Transactions: Once recorded on the blockchain, crypto transactions are practically unalterable. This permanence ensures transparency and prevents tampering.</li>\n<li>No Chargebacks: Unlike credit card payments, where chargebacks can occur due to disputes or fraud, crypto transactions are irreversible. Sellers receive their funds without the risk of chargebacks.</li>\n<li>User Control: With crypto wallets, users have direct control over their funds. No central authority can freeze or seize assets, providing financial autonomy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/two-factor-authentication\">Two-Factor Authentication</a> (2FA): Many crypto wallets offer 2FA, an extra layer of security. Users must verify their identity through a separate device or app before accessing their wallet.</li>\n<li>Cold Storage: Storing crypto offline (cold storage) minimizes exposure to online threats. Hardware wallets or paper wallets are popular cold storage methods.</li>\n<li>Smart Contracts: Ethereum and other platforms allow for programmable contracts (smart contracts). These self-executing agreements enhance security by automating processes without intermediaries.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Global Access</h3>\n<p>One of the main advantages over traditional currencies tied to specific countries is that cryptos don’t care about borders. Whether you’re in New York or Bali, you can send or receive funds instantly.</p>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies eliminate the complexities of currency conversion. Their universal acceptance ensures seamless transactions, regardless of borders.</p>\n<p>The key benefit of this is related to your potential customers from around the world. There won’t be no difference when it comes to which country a buyer is from. There are no conversion fees, which is the case with standard payments.</p>\n<h3>Lower Transaction Fees</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_164\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-164\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-164 size-full\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lower-Transaction-Fees.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lower-Transaction-Fees.png 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lower-Transaction-Fees-300x169.png 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lower-Transaction-Fees-768x432.png 768w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Lower-Transaction-Fees-1536x864.png 1536w\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-164\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: academy.binance.com</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As we already mentioned, there are always certain fees that you must pay when using traditional payment methods like a credit card.</p>\n<p>That is affecting businesses as well since they must calculate those fees, and integrate them into the price so they can stay competitive on the market.</p>\n<p>On the other side, use of crypto is much cheaper, leading to a higher profit for businesses, but also allowing them to keep lower prices, and attracting more customers in the end.</p>\n<h3>Fast Transactions</h3>\n<p>Cryptocurrencies redefine the speed of <a href=\"https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/financial-transaction/\">financial transactions</a>. When you pay with crypto, the process is swift—no waiting for bank approvals or payment processing delays.</p>\n<p>The moment you hit “Confirm,” the funds zip across the digital highway. For e-commerce platforms, this speed translates to happier customers, reduced cart abandonment rates, and streamlined order processing.</p>\n<h3>Privacy</h3>\n<p>When you pay with cryptocurrencies, your transactions remain discreet. Unlike credit cards, where every detail is recorded, crypto payments allow users to conduct business without revealing personal information. No need to share your name, address, or credit card number.</p>\n<p>And businesses benefit too – fewer data breaches mean less hassle.</p>\n<h3>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a publicly viewable digital ledger called the blockchain. Anyone can verify these transactions, ensuring openness and accountability.</p>\n<p>Once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it’s there forever. No alterations, no hidden changes.</p>\n<p>With crypto, there’s no need for intermediaries like banks or payment processors. Transactions occur directly between parties, reducing opacity and potential manipulation.</p>\n<p>Also, users can track their payments in real time. Therefore, there is no need to wait for bank statements or worry about hidden fees.</p>\n<h3>You Must Keep Up With Trends</h3>\n<p>It is essential to check on your rivals on the market and see which innovations they are implementing to stay ahead. Since crypto is a huge trend in recent years, avoiding to implement crypto payments may cause your business to fall behind.</p>\n<p>Also, it is important to evaluate official regulations and new laws that we can find in many countries, with a main focus on regulating this market. That is another proof that crypto is here to stay, and we expect that majority of people will adopt it in few years.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_165\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-165\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-165 size-full\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/crypto-payments.jpeg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/crypto-payments.jpeg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/crypto-payments-300x188.jpeg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/crypto-payments-768x480.jpeg 768w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/crypto-payments-1536x960.jpeg 1536w\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-165\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: financefeeds.com</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As you can see, there is a long list of benefits your online business will secure with the adoption of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>While it is quite advanced and complex by itself, the whole process is quite simple. And what is even more important, your platform will become safer since chances of data breaches will go to minimum.</p>\n<p>Besides that, the fact that you are providing flexibility to your customers can also bring more of them. When an online store offers a combination of standard and advanced payment methods, people will find it more reliable and trustworthy.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com/integrating-cryptocurrency-payments-into-web-design/\">Integrating Cryptocurrency Payments Into Web Design: New Opportunities For E-Commerce</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com\">CSS Triggers</a>.</p>\n",

    "title": "How to Disable Links Using only CSS – Kill the Link",
    "content": "<p>In web development, links are an essential part of creating a seamless user experience. However, there may be instances where you need to disable a link, and you can do so easily using CSS. By using the “pointer-events” property in CSS, you can disable links without having to modify the HTML code. In this blog post, we will explore how to disable links using only CSS, so you can take full control over your website’s functionality and design.</p>\n<h2>Why You Might Want to Disable a Link</h2>\n<p>There are several reasons why you might want to disable a link on your website. Perhaps you want to prevent users from clicking on a link that is no longer relevant, or you want to temporarily remove a link until you can update its destination.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you might want to disable links for design purposes, creating a visual cue that a particular section of your website is inactive or under construction.</p>\n<h2>The Benefits of Disabling Links with CSS</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-115 size-large\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Use-CSS-for-disabling-links-741x417.jpg\" alt=\"Use CSS for disabling links\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Use-CSS-for-disabling-links.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Use-CSS-for-disabling-links-300x169.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Use-CSS-for-disabling-links-768x432.jpg 768w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Use-CSS-for-disabling-links-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Use-CSS-for-disabling-links-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\"></p>\n<p>Disabling links using CSS has several benefits over modifying the HTML code. Firstly, it allows you to keep your <a href=\"https://www.turing.com/kb/what-goes-behind-writing-a-flawless-css-code\">HTML code clean and organized</a>, without having to add extra attributes or inline styles.</p>\n<p>Secondly, it provides a quick and easy way to disable links without having to make any changes to your website’s structure. Finally, using CSS to disable links gives you more control over the design and functionality of your website.</p>\n<h2>How to Use the Pointer-Events Property to Disable Links</h2>\n<p>To disable links using CSS, you can use the “pointer-events” property and set its value to “none”. This property allows you to control whether an element responds to mouse events such as clicks or hover.</p>\n<p>By setting it to “none”, you can effectively disable the link. Let’s look at some code that demonstrates the use of “pointer-events” when the a&gt; tag is disabled and the cursor attribute is set to “default”:</p>\n<h3>Create HTML</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"su-note\"><div class=\"su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">\n<p></p><h2>Disable link on current page</h2><p></p>\n<p><a href=\"”https://www.w3docs.com/”\" class=\"”disabled”\">Click Here</a></p>\n<p></p></div></div>\n<h3>Add CSS</h3>\n<p>Set the&nbsp;pointer-events&nbsp;to “none”, so as the element will never react to pointer-events.<br>\nSet the&nbsp;cursor&nbsp;to its “default” value to disable the anchor tag.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"su-note\"><div class=\"su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">\n<p>.disabled</p>\n<p>{ pointer-events: none; cursor: pointer; }</p>\n<p></p></div></div>\n<p>Here’s the full example.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Example of disabling a link on the current page:</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"su-note\"><div class=\"su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<title>Title of the document</title><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p><h2>Disable link on current page</h2><br>\n<a href=\"”https://www.w3docs.com/”\" class=\"”disabled”\">Click Here</a><br>\n<br>\n<p></p>\n<p></p></div></div>\n<h3>Example: Adding color and text decorations to disable the link</h3>\n<p>In the above example, the link is similar to the active link. We can differentiate the disabled link from the active link by adding some color and text-decoration properties.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"su-note\"><div class=\"su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<title>HTML</title><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n</p><h2>Disable a link using CSS </h2><br>\n<p> The links will not work as it has been disabled</p><br>\n<a href=\"”https://www.studytonight.com/”\" class=\"”disabled”\"> Click Here</a><br>\n<p> The active link </p><br>\n<a href=\"”https://www.studytonight.com/”\" class=\"”active”\"> Click Here </a><br>\n<br>\n<p></p>\n<p></p></div></div>\n<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid when Disabling Links with CSS</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-135 size-large\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Disabling-Links-with-CSS-741x475.jpg\" alt=\"Disabling Links with CSS\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Disabling-Links-with-CSS.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Disabling-Links-with-CSS-300x192.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Disabling-Links-with-CSS-768x492.jpg 768w\"></p>\n<p>When disabling links with CSS, there are a few common mistakes to avoid. Firstly, make sure that the “pointer-events” property is set to “none” and not “auto”, which is the default value. Secondly, ensure that you are targeting the correct link <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com/multiple-class-id-and-class-selectors/\">using the class selector</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, be careful not to disable links that are essential for the functionality of your website.</p>\n<h2>Creative Ways to Style Disabled Links</h2>\n<p>While disabled links are typically styled in a way that indicates that they are inactive, you can also get creative with your styling. For example, you could add an animation to the link to create a visual cue that it is disabled, or you could use a different color or font style to distinguish it from active links.</p>\n<p>Here are some CSS code examples to help you style disabled links:</p>\n<p>Use a different color:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"su-note\"><div class=\"su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">\n<p><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">a</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.disabled</span> {<br>\n<span class=\"hljs-attribute\">color</span>: gray;<br>\n}<br>\n</code></p>\n<p>This will change the color of disabled links to gray.</p>\n<p></p></div></div>\n<p>Change the cursor:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"su-note\"><div class=\"su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">\n<p><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">a</span><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.disabled</span> {<br>\n<span class=\"hljs-attribute\">cursor</span>: not-allowed;<br>\n}<br>\n</code></p>\n<p>This will change the cursor to a circle with a slash through it when the user hovers over a disabled link.</p>\n<p></p></div></div>\n<p>Add a visual effect:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"su-note\"><div class=\"su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">\n<p><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs

    "content": "<p>Two of the most commonly used selector types are multiple class / ID selectors and class selectors. To ensure consistency in website design, it’s important to have a unified style throughout the entire page.</p>\n<p>However, achieving this can be a daunting task for web developers, as going through each element to ensure that they conform to the correct form can be time-consuming and tedious.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there is a solution to this problem: CSS selectors. By using selectors, developers can identify and group elements together, allowing them to share design elements and simplify the coding process.</p>\n<p>Among the five categories of selectors available, this article focuses on the simple selectors: ID and class selectors. While IDs and classes can be tricky to work with at first, once you get the hang of using them, they can make your code cleaner and easier to structure.</p>\n<p>With the help of these signifiers, web developers can easily block and style elements as needed, avoiding inconsistencies and creating a more cohesive design across the entire website.</p>\n<p>But before you jump right into this article, e<span>levate your web design abilities by exploring our comprehensive guide on <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com/disable-links-using-only-css/\">disabling links using only CSS</a>, a clever technique to effectively manage link functionality while maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface.</span></p>\n<h2>What Is ID?</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-121 size-large\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ID-in-HTML-and-CSS-741x469.jpg\" alt=\"ID in HTML and CSS\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ID-in-HTML-and-CSS.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ID-in-HTML-and-CSS-300x190.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ID-in-HTML-and-CSS-768x486.jpg 768w\"></p>\n<p>In HTML and CSS, an ID is a unique identifier that allows developers to apply specific styles to a single element on a webpage. Unlike classes, which can be applied to multiple elements, each element can only have one ID and each page can only have one element with that specific ID.</p>\n<div class=\"flex-1 overflow-hidden\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-dxwhv-79elbk h-full dark:bg-gray-800\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-dxwhv-1n7m0yu\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col items-center text-sm dark:bg-gray-800\">\n<div class=\"w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">\n<p>For instance, if we have five divs in our HTML, we can assign each of them the same ID and style them with the same properties, such as making them green and 60 pixels tall.</p>\n<p>To identify an ID in CSS, we use the hash character (#) followed by the ID name.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"su-note\"><div class=\"su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">\n<p>div{<br>\nbackground-color: #008000;<br>\nheight: 60px;<br>\n}</p></div></div>\n<h2>What Is Class?</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-123 size-large\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-Is-Class-741x425.jpg\" alt=\"What Is Class\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-Is-Class.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-Is-Class-300x172.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-Is-Class-768x441.jpg 768w\"></p>\n<p>In CSS, classes are a useful tool for applying the same styles to multiple elements throughout a webpage or website.</p>\n<p>Unlike IDs, classes are not unique to a single element and can be assigned to multiple elements. Additionally, while an element can only have one ID, it can have multiple classes.</p>\n<p>To identify a class in CSS, we use a period (.) followed by the class name. For example, if we want all elements with the class “center” to be centered and green, we can apply the necessary styles to that class in our CSS file or within the HTML document.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"su-note\"><div class=\"su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">.center {<br>\ntext-align: center;<br>\ncolor: green;<br>\n} </div></div>\n<h2>What’s the Difference Between ID vs. Class?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>When it comes to using classes and IDs in CSS, it can be difficult to determine when to use each selector, as they both accomplish similar tasks.</p>\n<p>However, the difference lies in the scale and execution of the action, and with practice, developers can gain a better understanding of when to use each one.</p>\n<p>To better understand the difference between IDs and classes, we can use the analogy of barcodes and serial numbers. Just like all products in an electronics store have a barcode and a unique serial number, all elements on a webpage can have both an ID and a class.</p>\n<p>The barcode, like an ID, provides specific information about a product or element, but it doesn’t differentiate one from another. On the other hand, a serial number, like a class, is unique to a specific product or element and can identify it even without providing specific information.</p>\n<p>In practice, it’s common for a single element to have both an ID and one or more classes associated with it, allowing developers to apply specific styles and attributes to that element as needed.</p>\n<h2>Which Should You Choose?</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-125 size-large\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Difference-Between-ID-vs.-Class-741x425.jpg\" alt=\"Difference Between ID vs. Class\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Difference-Between-ID-vs.-Class.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Difference-Between-ID-vs.-Class-300x172.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Difference-Between-ID-vs.-Class-768x441.jpg 768w\"></p>\n<p>When it comes to using IDs and classes in CSS, it can be challenging to know when to use each one correctly. While using either one won’t necessarily be incorrect, identifying the proper signifier for each element will lead to cleaner code that is easier to work with in the long run.</p>\n<p>Regardless of whether you choose to use an ID or a class, it’s important to clearly identify the elements you are referencing.</p>\n<p>What may make sense to you initially could become less clear after some time away from the code. By carefully selecting and labeling your elements, you can ensure that your code is easy to read, understand, and modify as needed.</p>\n<div class=\"flex-1 overflow-hidden\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-igolf-79elbk h-full dark:bg-gray-800\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-igolf-1n7m0yu\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col items-center text-sm dark:bg-gray-800\">\n<div class=\"group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">\n<div class=\"flex-1 overflow-hidden\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-igolf-79elbk h-full dark:bg-gray-800\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-igolf-1n7m0yu\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col items-center text-sm dark:bg-gray-800\">\n<div class=\"group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0 m-auto\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark\">\n<p>Improve your web design efficiency and ensure a smoother user experience by mastering the art of <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com/css-property-will-not-trigger-layout/\">identifying CSS properties that won’t trigger layouts</a>, a crucial skill that will optimize your website’s performance and responsiveness.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<h3>1. Is ID Stronger Than Class CSS?</h3>\n<p>In CSS, IDs are not necessarily “stronger” than classes, but they have a higher specificity value.</p>\n<p>This means that an ID selector will have a higher priority over a class selector when both are applied to the same element.</p>\n<p>For example, if we have a CSS rule for a div element with an ID of “example” and a class of “highlight”, and both the ID and class have conflicting styles, the style defined in the ID selector will take precedence over the style defined in the class selector.</p>\n<p>However, it’s important to note that using IDs excessively in CSS can make the code more difficult to maintain and modify, as IDs are unique to a single element and cannot be reused throughout the page or website.</p>\n<p>It’s generally best to use IDs sparingly and reserve them for unique elements that require specific styling while using classes for more general styling that can be applied to multiple elements.</p>\n<p>The final order is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Values defined as important</li>\n<li>Inline styles</li>\n<li>ID selectors</li>\n<li>Class selectors</li>\n<li>Element</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<h3>2. Difference between ID and CLASS in HTML?</h3>\n<div class=\"su-note\"><div class=\"su-note-inner su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Key</th>\n<th>ID</th>\n<th>Class</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Syntax</td>\n<td>Starts with “#” symbol followed by a unique name assigned</td>\n<td>Starts with “.” symbol followed by a class name</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Selector</td>\n<td>Only one ID selector can be attached to an element</td>\n<td>Multiple class selectors can be attached to an element</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Uniqueness</td>\n<td>Unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element</td>\n<td>Can be applied to multiple elements on a single page</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div></div>\n<h3>3. Is ID Faster Than Class CSS?</h3>\n<p>There is no significant difference in speed between using IDs and classes in CSS. While IDs have a higher specificity value and may be processed faster by the browser, the difference in performance is negligible and not noticeable in most cases.</p>\n<p>In general, the performance of CSS depends more on the complexity and size of the code, as well as the number of elements being styled. It’s important to write clean and efficient CSS code that is optimized for performance, rather than relying on a specific selector like ID or class to improve speed.</p>\n<h3>4. Can You Use Class and ID Together?</h3>\n<p>Yes, it is possible to use both class and ID together on the same HTML element. An element can have both a class and an ID assigned to it to provide more specific styling. For example, an element could have a class assigned to it for a general styling, such as a font family, and an ID assigned to it for a specific styling, such as a different font size or color.</p>\n<p>However, it’s important to remember that an ID can only be assigned to one element on a page, while a class can be assigned to multiple elements. Therefore, it’s best to use IDs sparingly for unique and specific elements, and use classes for more general styling that can be applied to multiple elements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Understanding the differences between ID and class selectors is crucial when styling web pages with CSS. While both serve similar purposes, they should be used appropriately to ensure proper styling and functionality of your website.</p>\n<p>Remember that IDs are unique and should be used sparingly, while classes can be applied to multiple elements and are ideal for general styling.</p>\n<p>With this knowledge, you can effectively use multiple class and ID selectors to <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/04/21/10-ways-to-make-your-website-stand-out-from-your-competitors/\">make your website stand out</a>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com/multiple-class-id-and-class-selectors/\">Multiple Class / ID and Class Selectors – Can you spot the difference?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com\">CSS Triggers</a>.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>In CSS, certain properties such as position, float, display, and z-index do not cause a layout recalculation when changed. This means that modifying these properties does not require the browser to reposition elements on the page.</p>\n<p>This can significantly enhance performance, especially for pages that are intricate or sizable.</p>\n<h2>What Causes Layout Recalculate Style?</h2>\n<p>A website’s styles may need to be recalculated for various reasons. For instance, changes to the website’s layout such as adding a new sidebar can cause existing elements’ styles to change, necessitating some recalculation to ensure correct display. Resizing the browser’s window can also affect element display and prompt style recalculation. In some instances, simply scrolling through a page can also trigger style recalculation to guarantee proper content display.</p>\n<h3>Inline CSS</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>Can be utilized to load CSS within a website’s HTML. However, this method can impact performance negatively. To boost performance, a CSS block is loaded for rendering by taking specific steps. DOM measurement occurs after a DOM mutation. When a force is interrupted, a forced reflow occurs, and the later stage of layout in Javascript is entered. Nothing is repainted or reflowed upon display if it is hidden.</p>\n<h3>FastDOM</h3>\n<p>is an <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/fastdom\">object-oriented library</a> that enables the automatic separation of reading and writing from and to the DOM. While inline styles may serve a purpose, they are not the most effective way to maintain website up-to-dateness. Torus Kit employs this strategy to attain fast element bounds while avoiding unnecessary reflows.</p>\n<h3>Use CSS Triggers To Avoid Recalculate Style</h3>\n<p>If you want to <a href=\"https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/writing-better-css/\">reduce the amount of recalculate style</a>, use properties that have a low impact on rendering performance. In addition, you can learn which CSS properties trigger layout, paint, and composite with CSS Triggers. As a result of these properties, rendering performance is worst in these cases.</p>\n<h2>What Causes Reflow CSS?</h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-100 size-large\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-Causes-Reflow-CSS-741x455.jpg\" alt=\"What Causes Reflow CSS\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-Causes-Reflow-CSS.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-Causes-Reflow-CSS-300x184.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/What-Causes-Reflow-CSS-768x472.jpg 768w\"></p>\n<p>CSS reflow can occur due to several reasons, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Outdated or poorly written CSS stylesheets make it harder for the browser to render the page correctly.</li>\n<li>Invalid or improperly formatted HTML code, which also requires more effort from the browser to render the page.</li>\n<li>Low-resolution browser settings result in smaller-sized page rendering, necessitating more work for the browser to scale up the page to the correct size.</li>\n<li>Slow or resource-limited computers cause the browser to take longer to render the page.</li>\n<li>Slow internet connections increase download and rendering times, making the browser work harder.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition, resizing the browser window using JavaScript, adding or removing elements from a DOM, or changing a class can also trigger reflow. Drag-and-drop operations reduce graphics input, requiring the browser to resume evaluation with GetBoundingClientRect() and resulting in data reflow. However, using IntersectionObserver to run the script eliminates reflows and eliminates the need for changes. CSS properties can affect render performance in terms of layout, paint, and composite rendering.</p>\n<p>The behavior of resizing a browser window using JavaScript methods, adding or removing elements from a DOM, and changing a class can all cause reflow. A typical browser’s drag-and-drop operation reduces the amount of graphics input. Because it necessitates the reflow of data, the browser attempts to resume evaluation with GetBoundingClientRect(). If you run the script using IntersectionObserver, no reflows are encountered and no changes are required. The properties of CSS affect the performance of render layout, paint, and composite rendering.</p>\n<h3>Reflow: How To Make Your Web Page Responsive</h3>\n<p></p>\n<p>When creating a website, it is important to ensure that it can be viewed and used on various screen sizes and devices. This process involves rerendering the web page to fit the different screen sizes and device types.</p>\n<p>One way to achieve this is through responsive design, which allows the content to adjust and zoom for different screen sizes while retaining its information and functionality.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the content should not require two-dimensional scrolling unless it is necessary for specific parts that require two-dimensional functionality.</p>\n<h3>Does Translate Cause Reflow?</h3>\n<p>When a flow occurs, it may cause a change in the layout of a whole or part of a page, leading to the recalculated size and position of the affected elements and preventing animations. Reflow does not cause any changes to the translation, rotation, or scaling of the page.</p>\n<h3>Oral Translation: The Most Difficult Type Of Translation</h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-102 size-large\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Oral-Translation-741x494.jpg\" alt=\"Oral Translation\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Oral-Translation.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Oral-Translation-300x200.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Oral-Translation-768x512.jpg 768w\"></p>\n<p>Oral translation is often considered the most challenging form of translation as it requires the translator to have a deep understanding of both the source and target languages, as well as the cultures associated with them.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the translator must be able to convey the same message accurately and fluently in both languages. This can be especially difficult in certain cultures where written records may be limited or unavailable, making it harder to verify or confirm translations.</p>\n<h3>Why Adding Some CSS To An Element Might Cause Reflow To Happen?</h3>\n<p>Adding CSS to an element may cause a reflow to happen because it changes the layout of the element and potentially affects the position of other elements on the page. When the browser calculates the position and size of the element with the new CSS, it may need to recalculate the positions of other elements as well.</p>\n<p>This process of recalculating the layout of the page is known as reflow and can be time-consuming, especially for complex pages.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it is important to use CSS properties that have minimal impact on rendering performance to minimize the risk of causing a reflow and repaint.</p>\n<h2>What Triggers A Repaint?</h2>\n<p></p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://jelenaaa.medium.com/how-to-force-widget-to-redraw-in-flutter-2eec703bc024\">repaint is triggered when a widget needs to be redrawn</a>, either due to invalidation or changes in its size, position, or appearance.</p>\n<p>In the past, websites displayed only text, tables, and images. However, modern browsers allow us to inspect our code and understand what we are doing. When users enter a URL, the HTML source code is delivered to the browser, which then converts tokens like the head and body into nodes. The browser must learn how to display and style these nodes, which can result in reflow or repaint.</p>\n<p>Typing or changing the font size in an input box can affect repaint and reflow. However, modern browsers can create a queue of changes and perform them in stages. Applying a class instead of changing multiple CSS styles can help manage a RenderTree with more reflow capacity. Using absolute or fixed positioning on changing elements in CSS can also help avoid reflow and repaint.</p>\n<p>The inspector can display a timeline of reflow and repaint events, which can help identify performance issues. Instead of using the paint() method, the more specific repaint() method can be used to update only the necessary parts of a component.</p>\n<p>In Java swing, the paint() and repaint() methods are essential for specifying how a component will be painted. The paint() method contains instructions for painting a specific component, while the repaint() method updates the repainted component.</p>\n<h3>The Different Types Of Changes That Can Affect An Element’s Layout</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-104 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/The-Different-Types-Of-Changes-That-Can-Affect-An-Elements-Layout-741x462.jpg\" alt=\"The Different Types Of Changes That Can Affect An Element’s Layout\" srcset=\"https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/The-Different-Types-Of-Changes-That-Can-Affect-An-Elements-Layout.jpg 741w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/The-Different-Types-Of-Changes-That-Can-Affect-An-Elements-Layout-300x187.jpg 300w, https://csstriggers.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/The-Different-Types-Of-Changes-That-Can-Affect-An-Elements-Layout-768x478.jpg 768w\"></p>\n<p>Modifying the skin of an element can usually be seen by the user, but even changes that aren’t visible, like altering the outline, visibility, background, or color, can impact the element’s layout. Additionally, resizing the browser window or modifying element classes can also trigger a reflow, which affects layout.</p>\n<p>By taking advantage of this knowledge, I was able to improve my workplace application’s performance by 75%.</p>\n<h2>Layout Recalculation CSS</h2>\n<p>Layout recalculation is the process of determining the positions and sizes of elements in a web page. This is usually done by the browser, but can also be done by JavaScript. Layout recalculation is necessary when the size of an element or the page itself changes.</p>\n<p>When the DOM is changed, a reflow is only triggered once the DOM has been set. A repaint is when a section of an element’s skin is visibly rearranged, but its layout remains unchanged. To ensure that all other nodes in the DOM tree are visible, Opera recommends repainting the page several times. What are the benefits of browser reflow? When a browser must draw and process a large portion of a webpage again, reflow refers to it. What causes re repainting on car windows? A piece of clothing’s color and visibility changes, and the skin changes only as a result.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Change CSS3 Transform</h2>\n<div class=\"flex-1 overflow-hidden\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-qzyzb-79elbk h-full dark:bg-gray-800\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-qzyzb-1n7m0yu\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col items-center text-sm dark:bg-gray-800\">\n<div class=\"w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]\">\n<div class=\"text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0\">\n<div class=\"relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap\">\n<p>CSS3’s Transform is a powerful feature that enables you to modify an element’s appearance, size, shape, and behavior. With Transform, you can rotate an element, move it to a different location, or visually alter it by skewing, rotating, translating, or scaling it.</p>\n<p>To achieve a skew effect, both skewX and skewY can be used, along with rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ. The transform property accepts a list of values that are executed in a specific order, with the element’s scaling performed last. Additionally, the matrix transform function allows you to combine multiple matrix transforms into a single result.</p>\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n<h3>How Do You Transform Elements In CSS?</h3>\n<p>To transform elements in CSS, you can use the <code>transform</code> property along with various functions such as <code>rotate()</code>, <code>translate()</code>, <code>scale()</code>, and <code>skew()</code>.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of how to transform elements in CSS:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Rotate an element 45 degrees:\n<div class=\"bg-black mb-4 rounded-md\">\n<div class=\"p-4 overflow-y-auto\"><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-attribute\">transform</span>: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">rotate</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">45deg</span>);<br>\n</code></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Translate an element 50 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down:\n<div class=\"bg-black mb-4 rounded-md\">\n<div class=\"p-4 overflow-y-auto\"><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-attribute\">transform</span>: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">translate</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">50px</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">20px</span>);<br>\n</code></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Scale an element to be twice its original size:\n<div class=\"bg-black mb-4 rounded-md\">\n<div class=\"p-4 overflow-y-auto\"><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-attribute\">transform</span>: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">scale</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>);<br>\n</code></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Skew an element horizontally by 20 degrees:\n<div class=\"bg-black mb-4 rounded-md\">\n<div class=\"p-4 overflow-y-auto\"><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-attribute\">transform</span>: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">skewX</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">20deg</span>);<br>\n</code></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>Combine multiple transformations:\n<div class=\"bg-black mb-4 rounded-md\">\n<div class=\"p-4 overflow-y-auto\"><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-attribute\">transform</span>: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">rotate</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">45deg</span>) <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">translate</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">50px</span>, <span class=\"hljs-number\">20px</span>) <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">scale</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>);<br>\n</code></div>\n</div>\n<p>This rotates the element 45 degrees, moves it 50 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down, and doubles its size.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What Is CSS Transform In Html?</h3>\n<p>In HTML and CSS, the ‘transform’ property is used to modify the appearance and behavior of an element. It is a CSS3 property that allows you to visually transform an element by changing its size, position, or orientation. The transform property works by applying a set of mathematical functions to an element, such as rotate(), translate(), scale(), and skew().</p>\n<p>By using the ‘transform’ property, you can create a wide range of visual effects in HTML and CSS. For example, you can rotate an element, move it to a different location, change its size, or skew it. The ‘transform’ property also allows you to combine multiple transformations together to create more complex effects.</p>\n<p>Overall, the transform property is a powerful tool in HTML and CSS that allows you to modify the appearance and behavior of an element in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3>Why Do We Translate Transform In CSS?</h3>\n<p>In CSS, the translate() function is used as part of the transform property to move an element horizontally and/or vertically on the screen. We use the translate() function in CSS transform for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Positioning: ‘translate()’ allows you to position an element precisely where you want it on the screen, even if the element’s position is originally static or relative. This can be useful when you want to create a specific layout or when you need to move an element in response to user interaction.</li>\n<li>Animations: ‘translate()’ can be used to create animations by moving an element from one position to another over time. For example, you can use translate() to create a slide-in animation for a sidebar or menu.</li>\n<li>Performance: ‘translate()’ is often more performant than using absolute positioning or margins to move an element. This is because translate() is optimized for hardware acceleration and can be animated using the GPU, resulting in smoother animations and better performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the translate() function is a powerful tool in CSS transform that allows you to move and position elements on the screen with precision, create animations, and improve performance.</p>\n<h3>CSS Translate Function Moves Text?</h3>\n<p>In CSS, the translate() function is used to move an element, including text, horizontally and/or vertically on the screen. When translate() is applied to text, it appears to move as a block, retaining its original shape and font properties. The movement of the text can be smooth or abrupt, depending on the duration and timing function of the animation or transition applied to the translate() function.</p>\n<p>For example, if you wanted to move a paragraph of text 50 pixels to the right, you could use the following CSS code:</p>\n<div class=\"bg-black mb-4 rounded-md\">\n<div class=\"p-4 overflow-y-auto\"><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-tag\">p</span> {<br>\n<span class=\"hljs-attribute\">transform</span>: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">translateX</span>(<span class=\"hljs-number\">50px</span>);<br>\n}</code><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-css\"></code></div>\n</div>\n<p>This would move the entire paragraph 50 pixels to the right, preserving its original font properties, such as font size, color, and weight.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you could move the text vertically by using the translateY() function, or move it diagonally by using both translateX() and translateY() together.</p>\n<p>Overall, the translate() function is a useful tool in CSS for moving text and other elements on the screen, allowing for precise positioning and animation.</p>\n<h3>How Do I Change My Origin CSS?</h3>\n<p>In CSS, you can change the ‘transform-origin’ of an element using the ‘transform-origin’ property. The transform-origin determines the point around which an element is rotated or scaled when a transform function is applied.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to change the ‘transform-origin’ of an element in CSS:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose the new ‘transform origin’: The ‘transform origin’ is defined by its x and y coordinates, which are expressed as percentages or length values. For example, transform-origin: 50% 50%; sets the origin to the center of the element.</li>\n<li>Apply the transform-origin property: To change the ‘transform origin’, simply add the transform-origin property to the CSS for your element and specify the new coordinates. For example, to set the ‘transform origin’ to the top left corner of the element, you would use the following code:</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"bg-black mb-4 rounded-md\">\n<div class=\"p-4 overflow-y-auto\"><code class=\"!whitespace-pre hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.my-element</span> {<br>\n<span class=\"hljs-attribute\">transform-origin</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span>;<br>\n}<br>\n</code></div>\n</div>\n<p>This sets the ‘transform-origin’ to the upper left corner of the element.</p>\n<p>You can also use the ‘transform-origin’ property with different units, such as pixels or ems, to specify a specific distance from the edge of the element.</p>\n<p>Overall, changing the ‘transform-origin’ of an element in CSS is a simple way to control how it is transformed with transform functions like rotate(), scale(), and skew().</p>\n<h3>The Different Types Of CSS?</h3>\n<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and layout HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) web pages. There are different types of CSS that are commonly used, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inline CSS: This involves adding CSS styles directly to an HTML element, using the <code>style</code> attribute. Inline CSS styles only affect the specific element they are applied to.</li>\n<li>Internal CSS: This involves adding CSS styles to an HTML document, using the <code>style</code> tag within the <code>head</code> section. Internal CSS styles apply to all elements within the HTML document.</li>\n<li>External CSS: This involves creating a separate CSS file with all the styles and linking it to the HTML document using the <code>link</code> tag. External CSS styles can be reused across multiple HTML pages, making it easier to maintain a consistent design across a website.</li>\n<li>CSS frameworks: These are pre-written CSS code libraries that provide a set of pre-defined styles and layouts for web development. Popular CSS frameworks include Bootstrap, Foundation, and Bulma.</li>\n<li>CSS preprocessors: These are scripting languages that extend the functionality of CSS by allowing developers to use variables, functions, and other programming concepts in their CSS code. Popular CSS preprocessors include Sass, Less, and Stylus.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com/css-property-will-not-trigger-layout/\">Which CSS Property Will Not Trigger Layout? – Web Design Efficiency Hacks</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://csstriggers.com\">CSS Triggers</a>.</p>\n",
